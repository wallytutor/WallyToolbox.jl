[FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/index.php) is an open source design tool that with its 1.0 release confirmed itself as the leading in the domain. This document aim at maintaining a tutorial of its use for computational mechanics engineers and those in related fields.

## Installation

Go to the [download page](https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php) and get the version for your operating system. For Windows users it is simpler to get the portable version (7z) as it requires no administration rights. Under Linux only [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) bundles are available; for installing them, please check the ideas provided somewhere [around here](02-General-Computing-Skills.md). More about installation in the [FreeCAD Wiki](https://wiki.freecad.org/Installing_additional_components).

Upon first launch the application will ask for some trivial user preferences setup.
