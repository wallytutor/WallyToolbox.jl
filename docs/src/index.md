# WallyToolbox

My name is [Walter (CV)](https://github.com/wallytutor/WallyToolbox.jl/tree/main/data/curriculum/curriculum.pdf) and I like writing about science and engineering topics. I have more than a decade of scientific computing experience and a broad experience with open source software, especially in the fields of fluid dynamics and gas phase kinetics; a little of it being shared here.

During the years I tried to different formats to organize my study materials and working tools, but it was only recently that I realized that coupling my knowledge base with the documentation of my personal code was the best approach in terms of maintenance. Obviously I cannot migrate all the content I have ever produced here at once, so my decision was to restructure everything and have a fresh start, feeding content as required (*i.e.* somebody asked me a hand in a certain subject or I need to refresh certain skill at work). In this page you will also find the supporting materials of my Medium [articles](https://medium.com/@waltermateriais) and some additional content.
