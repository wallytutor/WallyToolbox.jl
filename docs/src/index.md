# WallyToolbox

My name is [Walter (CV)](https://github.com/wallytutor/WallyToolbox.jl/tree/main/data/curriculum/curriculum.pdf) and I like writing about science and engineering topics. I have more than a decade of scientific computing experience and a broad experience with open source software, especially in the fields of fluid dynamics and gas phase kinetics; a little of it being shared here.

During the years I tried to different formats to organize my study materials and working tools, but it was only recently that I realized that coupling my knowledge base with the documentation of my personal code was the best approach in terms of maintenance. Obviously I cannot migrate all the content I have ever produced here at once, so my decision was to restructure everything and have a fresh start, feeding content as required, *i.e.* somebody asked me a hand in a certain subject or I need to refresh certain skill at work. In this page you will also find the supporting materials of my Medium [articles](https://medium.com/@waltermateriais) and some additional content.

The core package of `WallyToolbox` ecosystem provides shared functionalities and types that are used in more specialized packages. This allows for standardization of interfaces, employed quantities, and avoid boilerplate code. This page organizes everything to facilitate the understanding of the end-user.

!!! info

    Over the time it is expected that many functionalities from other modules will integrate `WallyToolbox` as they become stable. In some cases, entire modules may become sub-modules, so you might need to check where to import some utilities as this package is rolling release.
