# Thermal conductivity of porous solids

Porous solids are characterized by the presence of voidance inside their volume; they may be formed through the sintering of particles with a given size distribution or through a foaming process. The former will lead to pores presenting a mostly convex geometry due to particle-particle contacts of  while the latter leads to concave pores, generally due to former gas bubbles during foaming process.
