# Analysis of transport phenomena

These notes are intended to provide a extensive overview of transport phenomena in a very succinct way. You can even see them as a cheat-sheet or simple lecture notes. They try to be straightforward and mostly self-contained an in the fundamental topics, with increased reference to external source in the more applied subjects. They were first redacted based on the series [Analysis of Transport Phenomena by Pr. Dr. Martin Bazant](https://mitxonline.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITxT+10.50.CH01x/) and further extended based on several sources cited along the way. The main goal is to provide a general approach of transport phenomena applied to Materials Science and Process Engineering, but readers of other fields might also be interested in parts of the contents.

*Note:* this is still a work in progress and quickly evolving. Please [let me know](mailto:walter.dalmazsilva.manager@gmail.com) if you found any typos or conceptual mistakes. I am still to ask some friends to review them.

2. [Applications to mass and heat transfer](<02 - Applications to mass and heat transfer.md>)
3. [Applications to fluid mechanics](<03 - Applications to fluid mechanics.md>)

Supporting the above we have the following annexes:

1. [Mathematical background](<A1 - Mathematical background.md>)
2. [Dimensionless groups](<A2 - Dimensionless groups.md>)

There are also some unstructured [drafts](<AX - Drafts.md>) being migrated to their final topics.
