## Derivation of conservation equations

In the nineteenth century, Fick demonstrated *empirically* that the flux density of a species submitted to gradient field responded linearly to its concentration $c$ gradient. Notice here $c$ takes the place of the more general $b$ in the conservation form derivation. In the more general case we should use subindexes for species concentrations and diffusivities, but that will be neglected here.

$$
\vec{F}\propto{}-\nabla{}c
$$

This is actually the simplest form of diffusion modeling and, in general, is valid only in very specific cases, *i.e.* when a single species is being transported in a system without the effect of other components. Introducing a proportionality coefficient $D$, the diffusivity, we have:

$$
\vec{F}=-D\nabla{}c
$$

Using this expression in our conservation equation leads to:
  
$$
\frac{\partial{}c}{\partial{}t} - \nabla\cdotp{\left(D\nabla{}c\right)} - R_{v} = 0
$$

Under the very specific case where there is no volumetric production rate $R_{v}$, *i.e.* no chemical reactions, and constant diffusivity $D$, *i.e.* no composition or space dependence, this simplifies to the well-studied form of the so called Fick's second law:

$$
\frac{\partial{}c}{\partial{}t} = D\nabla^{2}{c}
$$

This expression happens to be isomorph with heat diffusion equation for a constant specific heat medium because Fourier's law is analogous to Fick's first law, leading to the same final mathematical form. Using the thermodynamic definition $dh=\rho{}c_{p}dT$ we have

$$
\frac{\partial{}T}{\partial{}t} = \frac{k}{\rho{}c_{p}}\nabla^{2}{T}
$$

It must be noticed that in the general case, the quantity being transported in heat equation is the enthalpy density $h$ and the potential field is linearized in terms of temperature $T$ through Fourier's equation. Without the constant specific heat simplification and with variable thermal conductivity $k$ it is stated as:

$$
\frac{\partial{}h}{\partial{}t} = \nabla\cdotp\left(k\nabla{T}\right)
$$

Other than for very simple enthalpy-specific heat relationships (such as the constant approximation discussed above), this PDE must be solved numerically with a coupled system of nonlinear equations for computing the field of temperatures in terms of enthalpies. In the above we neglect the volumetric heat production rate, which would be present, *e.g.* in a reacting system or a material undergoing nuclear fission.
