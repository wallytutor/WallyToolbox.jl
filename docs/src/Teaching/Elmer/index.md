# Elmer Multiphysics

Elmer is a multiphysics finite element method (FEM) solver mainly developed by CSC and maintained at [GitHub](https://github.com/ElmerCSC/elmerfem). Several resources can be found in is [official webpage](https://www.csc.fi/web/elmer) and in the [community portal](https://www.elmerfem.org/blog/). The goal of this page is not to supersede the [documentation](https://www.csc.fi/web/elmer/documentation), but to make it (partially) available as a webpage where search and navigation become more intuitive. *Notice that this will be fed according to my personal projects and learning, so any contribution to accelerate the process is welcome.*
