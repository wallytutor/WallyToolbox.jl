# Elmer Multiphysics

Elmer is a multiphysics finite element method (FEM) solver mainly developed by CSC and maintained at [GitHub](https://github.com/ElmerCSC/elmerfem). Several resources can be found in is [official webpage](https://www.csc.fi/web/elmer) and in the [community portal](https://www.elmerfem.org/blog/). The goal of this page is not to supersede the [documentation](https://www.csc.fi/web/elmer/documentation), but to make it (partially) available as a webpage where search and navigation become more intuitive. *Notice that this will be fed according to my personal projects and learning, so any contribution to accelerate the process is welcome.*

## Guided tour

### Quick answers

- [Is Elmer the adequate tool for my projects?](https://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/physics/elmer/doc/ElmerOverview.pdf) In this document you find a short introduction to what Elmer can do and the main executables. 

- [How do I start learning Elmer?](https://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/physics/elmer/doc/GetStartedElmer.pdf) Simply put, Elmer does not require basic users to master all the fundamentals of FEM, so following the *getting started* guide seems a good starting point.

- [Where do I get the binaries of Elmer?](https://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/physics/elmer/) If willing to run in Windows, the previous link provides the compiled binaries; there are also instructions for installing directly in Ubuntu as well as all the documentation and other test and sample cases.

### Using Elmer

- Newcomers might be interested in `ElmerGUI`; although very intuitive, the interface is quite limited and for complex programs running from command line is the preferred mode.

- Most users will finally end setting up an workflow employing both to `ElmerSolver` (to run the simulations) and `ElmerGrid` (to prepare the grid and setup parallelization).

- There is also `ViewFactors` which might be useful in special cases involving radiation and other executables but they are not mentioned here because they fall in the legacy code family.

- Users are encouraged to use external tools such as [gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) or [Salome](https://www.salome-platform.org/) to generate computational meshes, built-in support in Elmer bein limited to very simple geometries only.

- Also for postprocessing the recommended way is by using external tools as [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) and [PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/), both handling well the VTK format of outputs.

## Creating a case

- It is counter-intuitive, but to load a mesh in GUI one goes to `File > Open`, which can load several formats. Here we are using only `UNV` meshes generated by `gmsh`.

- Activate heat equation for all bodies in system and rename it to `Conduction`.

- Add two materials (`Portland`  and `Refractory`) and configure properties are needed.
	- Under `General` provide density and heat capacity
	- Under `Heat Equation` set heat conductivity

- Create an initial condition and set temperature to 298.15 K for all bodies.

- Create boundary conditions:
	- `Heat Source`at boundary 8 and set a Dirichlet condition for temperature of 813.15 K
	- `Symmetry` at boundaries 6/7 and set heat flux to 0 W (no gradient).
	- `Soil` at boundaries 1/2 and set a Dirichlet condition for temperature of 298.15 K.
	- `Environment` at boundary 3 and provide an HTC of 10 W/m/K and temperature of 298.15 K.

- Go to `Model > Setup` and check it defaults to steady state simulation.

- Inspect `Model > Summary...` before generating SIF file.
 
- Generate SIF with `Sif > Generate`.

- Now simulation is ready to `Run > Start solver`, inspect logs after finish.

- Before serious postprocessing, inspect solution with `Run > Start ElmerVTK`
