# Elmer Multiphysics

## Creating a case

- It is counter-intuitive, but to load a mesh in GUI one goes to `File > Open`, which can load several formats. Here we are using only `UNV` meshes generated by `gmsh`.

- Activate heat equation for all bodies in system and rename it to `Conduction`.

- Add two materials (`Portland`  and `Refractory`) and configure properties are needed.
	- Under `General` provide density and heat capacity
	- Under `Heat Equation` set heat conductivity

- Create an initial condition and set temperature to 298.15 K for all bodies.

- Create boundary conditions:
	- `Heat Source`at boundary 8 and set a Dirichlet condition for temperature of 813.15 K
	- `Symmetry` at boundaries 6/7 and set heat flux to 0 W (no gradient).
	- `Soil` at boundaries 1/2 and set a Dirichlet condition for temperature of 298.15 K.
	- `Environment` at boundary 3 and provide an HTC of 10 W/m/K and temperature of 298.15 K.

- Go to `Model > Setup` and check it defaults to steady state simulation.

- Inspect `Model > Summary...` before generating SIF file.
 
- Generate SIF with `Sif > Generate`.

- Now simulation is ready to `Run > Start solver`, inspect logs after finish.

- Before serious postprocessing, inspect solution with `Run > Start ElmerVTK`
