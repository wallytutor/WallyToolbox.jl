## Mount a network drive in WSL

Here we assume we will mount drive `Z:` at `/mnt/z`:

```bash
# Create the mount point (if required):
sudo mkdir /mnt/z

# Mount the network drive in WSL:
sudo mount -t drvfs Z: /mnt/z
```

## $\LaTeX$

### Math typesetting with $\LaTeX$

- For integrals to display the same size as fractions expanded with `\dfrac`, place a `\displaystyle` in front of the `\int` command.

### Code typesetting with $\LaTeX$

- For some reason `minted` blocks `\begin{minted}...\end{minted}` have problems to render in Beamer (something related to multilevel macros). I managed to insert code blocks with `\inputminted` as reported [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/159667/including-python-code-in-beamer)
