# Limitations and issues

- Currently the GUI is not able to import SIF files generated manually because it stores its state in a XML file; to be able to re-run cases from the GUI users need to create the equivalent case (eventually using the free text fields) in the GUI itself before regenerating a SIF file. Notice that this will overwrite the SIF file, so keep in mind to backup the file in another directory; that is especially required for highly customized cases.
