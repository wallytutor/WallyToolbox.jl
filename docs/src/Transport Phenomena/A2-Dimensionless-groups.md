# Dimensionless groups
## G

[**Grashof:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grashof_number) Ratio of buoyancy to viscous forces defined as $\mathrm{Gr}=\frac{g\beta(T_s-T_{\infty})L^3}{\nu^2}$ and is analogous to Reynolds number in natural convection. Increasing the value of this number above a given threshold promotes buoyancy driven flow.
## K

**Knudsen:** Particles mean free path over system characteristic dimension. Division between rarefied gas (Boltzmann) and continuum mechanics (Navier-Stokes).
## N

[**Nusselt:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusselt_number) Ratio of convective to conductive heat transfer at a boundary in a fluid, defined as $\mathrm{Nu}=\frac{hL}{k}$. Often in buoyancy-driven flow analysis it is correlated as $\mathrm{Nu}=a\mathrm{Ra}^b$. A Nusselt number of value one represents heat transfer by pure conduction. Increasing this number implies a laminar conductive-dominant flow and then a convective dominant turbulent flow.
## P

[**Péclet:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Péclet_number) provides the ratio of advective per diffusive transport of a substance. For mass transport this is given by the product of Reynolds and Schmidt numbers $\mathrm{Re}\,\mathrm{Sc}$ while for thermal energy it is the product of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers $\mathrm{Re}\,\mathrm{Pr}$.

**Prandtl:** Ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity $\mathrm{Pr}=\frac{\nu}{\alpha}$. High $\mathrm{Pr}$ indicates that momentum transfer is more effective than heat transfer (oils), while low values (liquid metals) indicate thermal boundary layer is more important than viscous one.
## R

[**Rayleigh:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_number) Product of Grashof $\mathrm{Gr}$ and Prandtl $\mathrm{Pr}$ numbers. Related to the transition from laminar to turbulent in buoyancy-driven flows. Laminar to turbulent is assumed to take place at $10^9$  ([[@Balaji2014]]).
## S

[**Sherwood**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherwood_number):  Also called the **mass transfer [Nusselt number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusselt_number "Nusselt number")** is a dimensionless number used in mass-transfer operation. It represents the ratio of the total mass transfer rate (convection + diffusion) to the rate of diffusive mass transport, and is named in honor of [Thomas Kilgore Sherwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kilgore_Sherwood "Thomas Kilgore Sherwood").
## W

[**Weber**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_number): This group is often found in applications of multiphase flows where strongly curved surfaces are present. It represents the ratio of drag forces to cohesion forces, and can be thought of as a measure of the relative importance of the fluid's inertia compared to its surface tension. As reminded by ([[@Amsden1989]]), for $\mathrm{We}>1$, *drop oscillations, distortions, and breakup must be considered*, requiring other sub-models other than simple drag to describe the flow.
