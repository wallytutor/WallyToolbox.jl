# Analysis of transport phenomena

Theses notes intend to provide in a very concise way overview of the mathematical fundamentals of transport phenomena. In this sense, they are devoted to generalities rather than specific closure models. You can even see them as a cheat-sheet or simple lecture notes. 

In that sense, they try to be straightforward and mostly self-contained in the fundamental topics, with increased reference to external sources in applied subjects. They were first redacted based on the MITx series [Analysis of Transport Phenomena by Pr. Dr. Martin Bazant](https://mitxonline.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITxT+10.50.CH01x/) and further extended based on several sources cited along the way. 

The main goal is to provide a general approach of transport phenomena applied to Materials Science and Process Engineering, but readers of other fields might also be interested in parts of the contents.

*Note:* this is still a work in progress and quickly evolving. Please [let me know](mailto:walter.dalmazsilva.manager@gmail.com) if you found any typos or conceptual mistakes. I am still to ask some friends to review them.

There are also some unstructured [drafts](AX-Drafts.md) being migrated to their final topics.
