## Installation

A compressed package with binaries for both Linux and Windows (in the same file) can be retrieved [here](https://dual.sphysics.org/downloads/) while the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DualSPHysics/DualSPHysics).

- Start with extracting the compressed file to a directory of choice.
- There is no need to add the software to the path (batch scripts managed).

The following video provides a discussion of the above steps.
