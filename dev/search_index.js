Simulation was checked before adding the cloud, which exponentially complexifies the setup.\n- A `patchPostProcessing` cloud function was tested at first to check if conditions were leading to complete fuel evaporation. It is kept commented-out for future debug if required. To make results easier to interpret, a fixed size PSD was adopted at this stage.\n- As expected, convergence is bad and the only strategy that seems to work is mesh refinement. Otherwise pressure coupling becomes difficult and trying to change numerical parameters (solver correctors, linear solver, divergence and Laplacian schemes, relaxation level) do not improve anything. Tried to use `SOI` at a later iteration to let flow converge before injection, but apparently the steady solver ignores this. Even with `localEuler` pseudo-time stepping (requires to add residuals for `rho` in `fvSolution`) it does not seem to take `SOI` into account.  Also tried deactivating clouds and converging before reactivating it (what would be equivalent to the later `SOI` approach) and that does not work either, confirming it is a physical coupling problem.\n- Because of mesh refinement, now parallelization becomes a requirement unless we work with mesh grading, what is out of the present scope (to be done only in production scenario).

The first because it is the only case under multicomponentFluid solver currently using a steadyState time-stepping scheme and the latter due to the use of localEuler, which is often used to produce pseudo-steady solutions when a direct steady state calculations becomes unstable (as it is the case in most combustion calculations).\nModify controlDict to integer steps (that is, each step is an iteration) for both time-step and write controls, and enable purgeWrite to keep case cleaner. Notice that this is also valid if using a localEuler time-stepping scheme.  Change time-stepping method accordingly in fvSchemes.\nTo increase robustness of solution, it is recommended to compute a potential flow with potentialFoam as in reference case verticalChannelLTS. This requires a solver control field Phi in fvSolution and a  reference rhoInlet value to be provided in inlet flow velocity. Other parameters, but specially maxCo are also copied from reference case.\nSome dictionaries in cloudProperties require steady-state specific commands, such as adding calcFrequency to solution,  resetOnStartup to solution.sourceTerms, and injection models must use massFlowRate, what is physically understandable.\nCombustion is quite sensitive and Seulex alone does not seem able to handle it with an EDC approach. First flow was developed further during 100 steps before activating chemistry.

It happens that most quality materials for learning FEM are applied to structural analysis (because that is the most import numerical method in that field). Because my applied work is mostly related to fluids and heat transfer, doing some bibliographic research I found the books by Lewis et al. and its newer edition by Nithiarasu et al. adapted to my expertise level.\nFrom a mathematical standpoint the most accessible material I have studied so far is the draft book by H. P. Langtangen and K.-A. Mardal. Unfortunatelly the main author deceased just after the release of the final draft and the material remained unfinished. That is not really a blocking point because the content is pretty much finished from a non-specialist standpoint. Furthermore, its exercises where converted into notebooks by Mojtaba Barzegari and the material is quite accessible.\nDuring the years I have tested several FEM packages and libraries. The most promissing FEM package in the open source world is certainly FEniCSx, but it comes with the disadvantage of requiring Linux/WSL and having an unclear documentation. In terms of power I couldn't find anything comparable to MOOSE - if you see the list of developer labs it becomes pretty clear why - but it is something to experienced FEM users since it requires low level implementation of the problems in C++. Elmer could be a candidate package for learning the practice, but for going into the mathematics of FEM it is not the right tool. Next comes Kratos but its documentation is messy and things moved around too much over the years. Finally we have FreeFEM++. It is a pretty old software what means that it outlived most of the other applications and now is very stable. What is interesting about FreeFEM++ is its portability across operating systems and good documentation. In what follows I will stick with FreeFEM++ and later with FEniCSx.\nLearning a numerical method for continuum mechanics is essentially useless without the capacity to apply it to real world geometries. Unfortunatelly the field of open source CAD is very poor so we have just a few options. Although Gmsh is pretty powerfull with respect to its meshing capabilities, conceiving the geometry with the software can quickly scale to trigonometry hell level. I have been using the software for many years for 2D cases but systematically fall back to proprietary software when things become complex. In this study I intend to reach a sorcerer Gmsh mastery level. It can be complemented by STL files generation with Blender or CAD in FreeCAD.\nAdvanced post-processing is also a must, so we will also follow some tutorials to improve ParaView skills.","category":"page"},{"location":"Teaching/Elmer/C1-Finite-Element-Method/","page":"Finite Element Method","title":"Finite Element Method","text":"</details>","category":"page"},{"location":"Teaching/Elmer/C1-Finite-Element-Method/#Software-version","page":"Finite Element Method","title":"Software version","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"Teaching/Elmer/C1-Finite-Element-Method/","page":"Finite Element Method","title":"Finite Element Method","text":"While doing such an ambitious study, it is important to stick with software versions.","category":"page"},{"location":"Teaching/Elmer/C1-Finite-Element-Method/","page":"Finite Element Method","title":"Finite Element Method","text":"In what follows we will be using exclusivelly the following software:","category":"page"},{"location":"Teaching/Elmer/C1-Finite-Element-Method/","page":"Finite Element Method","title":"Finite Element Method","text":"Gmsh 4.11.1\nFreeFEM++ 4.13\nParaView 5.10.1\nFreeCAD 0.21.1\nBlender 4.0.2","category":"page"},{"location":"Teaching/Elmer/C1-Finite-Element-Method/","page":"Finite Element Method","title":"Finite Element Method","text":"Processing utilities in Julia and/or Python will have their own versioning so they are not reported here.","category":"page"},{"location":"Teaching/Elmer/C1-Finite-Element-Method/#Study-planning","page":"Finite Element Method","title":"Study planning","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"Teaching/Elmer/C1-Finite-Element-Method/","page":"Finite Element Method","title":"Finite Element Method","text":"Because it can become frustrating to progress in the study and not be able to apply the knowledge to real cases, we will start by growing competencies in geometry and meshing before entering the mathematical and software aspects.

You can control the element orders in command line using option -order <N>; gmsh operates this way so that the same script can generate any supported element type.\nFor importing meshes one uses ElmerGrid <input-format> <output-format>, where the format arguments are documented in the manual sections 1.3 and 1.4. The UNV input is given by number 8 while standard ElmerSolver output by number 2, so that the conversion command would start with ElmerGrid 8 2 <other-arguments...>. Always verify the number of nodes remain untouched after conversion - or if it changed when using option -merge <dist>, merging nodes that are closer than the user-defined <dist>.\nRemember to use Coherence;  with OpenCASCADE factory in gmsh scripts to automatically strip internal faces; that might not be enough for complex cases, see below. Note: I tried doing so and unless Physical Surfaces naming the external boundaries are provided every interface is dumped and imported by Elmer; maybe I misunderstood the use of command!\nBecause faces are not named in Elmer, i.e. no matter what Physical Surface names you provide in gmsh, even for the advanced user working from command line it might be interesting to use the interactive zone grouping capabilities of ElmerGUI.

The former will lead to pores presenting a mostly convex geometry due to particle-particle contacts of  while the latter leads to concave pores, generally due to former gas bubbles during foaming process; these morphologies and the scale of porosity will lead to a broad range of properties in macroscopic behavior of materials. Other features related to the porosity might include the communicating character of pores or the validity of continuum mechanics in a given problem due to pore sizes. This subject has been treated by scholars of many fields because of its relevance to industrial processes, heat transfer in furnaces, biological systems, and more recently in heat storage and recovery devices, not to try to be exhaustive here; specific citations come next.","category":"page"},{"location":"Teaching/Transport Phenomena/B1-Conductivity-Porous-Solids/","page":"Thermal conductivity of porous solids","title":"Thermal conductivity of porous solids","text":"In what follows we will briefly review some of the afore mentioned applications and historical developments in the field before tackling the problem of modeling heat transfer in arbitrary materials. The goal of our literature review is to determine the limits of applicability and how well accepted are the available methods proposed in the past, but also to identify potential use cases of computational methods in materials design before proposing our own scenarios. The study will comprise situations allowing for analytical solution for solver validation, reproduction of previous published results, and the modeling of arbitrary solids.
