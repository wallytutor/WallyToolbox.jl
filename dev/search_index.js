The first because it is the only case under multicomponentFluid solver currently using a steadyState time-stepping scheme and the latter due to the use of localEuler, which is often used to produce pseudo-steady solutions when a direct steady state calculations becomes unstable (as it is the case in most combustion calculations).\nModify controlDict to integer steps (that is, each step is an iteration) for both time-step and write controls, and enable purgeWrite to keep case cleaner. Notice that this is also valid if using a localEuler time-stepping scheme.  Change time-stepping method accordingly in fvSchemes.\nTo increase robustness of solution, it is recommended to compute a potential flow with potentialFoam as in reference case verticalChannelLTS. This requires a solver control field Phi in fvSolution and a  reference rhoInlet value to be provided in inlet flow velocity. Other parameters, but specially maxCo are also copied from reference case.\nSome dictionaries in cloudProperties require steady-state specific commands, such as adding calcFrequency to solution,  resetOnStartup to solution.sourceTerms, and injection models must use massFlowRate, what is physically understandable.\nCombustion is quite sensitive and Seulex alone does not seem able to handle it with an EDC approach.
