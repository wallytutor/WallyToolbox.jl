id="documenter-page"><p>2</p><p>2.1</p><p>2.1.1</p><p>Basis</p><p>Thermodynamics</p><p>A short overview on the rules of thermodynamics shall be given here, with special emphasis on their consequences for computer calculations. This part will not replace a textbook on thermodynamics, but shall help the reader to remember its rules and maybe present them in a more practically useful way, which facilitates the understanding of thermodynamic calculations.</p><p>Thermodynamics deals with energy and the transformation of energy in various ways. In thermodynamics all rules are deduced from three principal laws, two of which are based on axioms expressing everyday experiences. Even though these laws are very simple, they have many important consequences.</p><p>Thermodynamics can strictly be applied only to systems that are at equilibrium, ie. in a state that does not change with time. As noted in the introduction, the thermodynamic models can be extrapolated outside the equilibrium state and provide essential information on thermodynamic quantities for simulations of time-dependent transformations of systems.</p><p>The equation of state</p><p>The concept of thermodynamic state must be introduced before beginning with the principal laws. This can be done by invoking the principle of the “equation of state.” This is connected with the introduction of temperature as a measurable quantity. If pressure-volume work is the only work considered, then one can state that in a homoge- neous unary system the state is defined by two variables. Of the three variables temperature T, pressure p, and volume V in a unary system, only two are independent, i.e. there exists a condition</p><p>F(T, p, V) =0 (2.1) which means that one of the three variables is determined by the other two:</p><p>V=fT.p);  T=f(V.p); or p=f(T,V) (2.2)  =========== Basis</p><p>A unary system consists of a single component, either an element from the periodic table or a molecule that will not form any other molecules under the conditions considered. For the definitions of the terms “homogeneous,” “system,” etc., any general textbook on thermodynamics, for example Hillert et al. (1998), can be consulted.</p><p>For each additional kind of work considered, e.g. magnetic or electric, an additional variable is necessary to define the state. Nevertheless, the above consideration is very useful and, if the pressure dependence can be neglected, the state functions of pure substances (unary phases) are functions of the temperature only.</p><p>For practical reasons a “state” may be defined for inhomogeneous systems, but that can be taken as a simplified notation for the sum or integral of (eventually infinitesimally small) homogeneous systems, for each of which the state has to be defined separately.</p><p>To define the state of non-unary (binary, ternary, ... ) systems, one needs additional variables, for example the amounts of the components. These may be replaced by mole- or mass-fractions together with the total amount.</p><p>The first law of thermodynamics</p><p>This law is derived from the axiom of conservation of energy. A formulation well suited for our purpose is the following: the sum of the heat and work transferred to an otherwise closed system defines a function not depending on the way in which this transfer took place. The function defined in this way is called the internal energy U. A “closed system” means a system that does not exchange any heat, work, or matter with its surrounding. Besides constant internal energy U, it has constant volume V and a constant amount of matter (expressed as constant amounts N, of different components i). All these quantities depend only on the “state” of the system and they are called state variables or state functions. The concept of state functions is very important in thermodynamics. A feature of the internal energy U, which must be kept in mind for numerical calculations, is that only differences between the values of this function for two well-defined states have a physical meaning. No absolute value of U can be defined.</p><p>If the system is opened and either heat, g, or work, w, is transferred to it from the surroundings, the above rule can be formulated in terms of a change of the internal energy:</p><p>AU =q+w (2.3)</p><p>Neither ¢ nor w is itself a state variable. Transferring either only heat or only work may be different ways of bringing about the same change of state.</p><p>The second law of thermodynamics</p><p>This law is derived from the axiom that a complete conversion of heat to work is not possible. It may be formulated as follows: a function of state, called entropy and denoted S, can be defined, which can increase, but never decrease, in a closed system. The state  =========== 2.1 Thermodynamics 9</p><p>in which the entropy of the closed system has its maximum is the equilibrium state. No further change of state can happen in this system as long as it remains closed.</p><p>The difference between the entropies of two well-defined states of a system (that is not closed) is defined by the integral</p><p>state 2 / S,-S,= (2) (2.4)</p><p>state 1 T</p><p>dQ is the infinitesimal amount of heat transferred to the system on the way from state 1 to state 2. The subscript “rev” indicates that the path from state 1 to state 2 must be reversible, which means that it is restricted to a sequence of equilibrium states. On going in non-reversible ways from state | to state 2, some work is added instead of heat. All real changes of state are irreversible, but a reversible change of state may be simulated by a Gedankenexperiment, i.e., an experiment that one may think of doing, but which it is impossible to do in reality.</p><p>The third law of thermodynamics</p><p>This law is derived from the axiom that it is impossible to reach the temperature of 0K. This temperature can be approached only asymptotically. A consequence of this axiom is that the change in entropy of a reversible reaction approaches 0 when the reaction temperature approaches 0K. By virtue of this law an absolute value can be defined for the state function entropy, S, in contrast to the internal energy U. By convention S is set to zero at OK.</p><p>Definition of some terms and symbols</p><p>A number of symbols will be used and the most important are summarized here. In most cases they refer to just one phase. Whenever more than one phase is involved, a superscript like @ or B will be used to distinguish the phases involved. A superscript tot will be used when it is emphasized that the symbol refers to the total value for the system, summed over all phases. A phase is distinguished by its crystal structure (see section 2.2), and at equilibrium its composition is homogeneous in space. The gas, liquid, and the amorphous or glass phase are also phases, even though they have no crystal structure. Names of phases are discussed in section 8.4.</p><p>The term “constituent” means any species that can be treated as an independent entity to describe the constitution of a phase, for example molecules in a gas or a defect in a</p><p>crystalline phase; see section 5.3.</p><p>the absolute temperature.</p><p>the gas constant, 8.31451 Jmol~! K~!. the pressure.</p><p>the volume.</p><p>the heat.</p><p>the number of moles of component i.</p><p>ZO&lt;cs P48  =========== 2.1.6</p><p>Basis</p><p>N the total number of moles, N = D/L, Nj.</p><p>Nx Avogadro’s number, 6.023 x 10” atoms per mole.</p><p>x; the mole fraction of component i, x; = N,/N.</p><p>y; _ the fraction of constituent 7. The sum of the constituent fractions is unity; however, since y, depends on the solution model for the phase, there may be more constituents than components, with the consequence that there is no general relation between the constituent fractions and the mole fractions.</p><p>Y _ short for denoting the constitution, i-e., all constituent fractions in a phase.</p><p>G _ the total Gibbs energy of a system.</p><p>G,, the Gibbs energy per mole of components of a system. G® the Gibbs energy per mole of components of phase 0. G® the partial Gibbs energy of component i in phase 0. °G? the Gibbs energy for the pure component i in phase 0.</p><p>b, the chemical potential of component i.</p><p>a, _ the activity of component i, a; = exp[u;/(RT)]-</p><p>There are often several specifications to these symbols placed as superscripts and subscripts. The superscript is reserved for the phase, power, or sublattice indication. As subscript one can have the normalization “m” or the specification of a component or other things. The “pre”-superscript is used to specify that the symbol is for a pure element, “°”, an excess quantity “&quot;” or anything else that does not fit as a subscript.</p><p>Equilibrium conditions and characteristic features</p><p>A first condition of equilibrium is that all parts of a system have the same tempera- ture and the same pressure. Inhomogeneities at equilibrium may occur only on having different “phases,” each of which, however, must be homogeneous in itself. This is a direct consequence of the second law. A system with a temperature gradient may be simplified by dividing it into hotter and colder parts. By transferring heat from a hotter part to a colder part, according to Eq. (2.4) the entropy loss in the hotter part is less than the entropy gain in the colder part, and thus the total entropy of the system is increased. Similarly, equilibration of composition gradients increases entropy. This can be shown by “van ’t Hoff’s equilibrium box,” as is explained in most textbooks on thermodynamics.</p><p>Experimentally, pressure differences can be maintained for quasi-infinite times and thus equilibrium with different pressures inside a system would seem possible. However, such a pressure barrier means that the system is divided into parts forming independent closed systems. Considering it as a single closed system implies that the pressure barrier can be opened.</p><p>Systems in equilibrium have single scalar values for temperature and pressure, the temperature and pressure of the system. A general system, in contrast, may have a temperature and a pressure field, i.e., temperature and pressure may vary with coordinates in space and the expression “temperature of the system” would be meaningless.</p><p> =========== 2.1 Thermodynamics 11</p><p>In an open system the differential of the internal energy can be expressed as a sum of products of an intensive variable and the differential of its “conjugate” extensive variable:</p><p>dU = T dS —pdV+&gt; dN, (2.5)</p><p>The conjugate pairs of an intensive and an extensive variable are thus temperature and entropy, T and S, negative pressure and volume, —p and V, as well as the chemical potential and amount of component i, 4; and N,.</p><p>Dividing Eq. (2.5) by T and exchanging the left-hand side with the first term on the right-hand side gives another series of conjugate pairs of variables:</p><p>1 &quot; ds = =du+2av-y Man, (2.6) T or</p><p>with the conjugate pairs 1/7, U; p/T, V; and q;/T, N,.</p><p>From section 2.1.3, the equilibrium condition can be formulated as follows: in a closed system equilibrium is reached when the entropy reaches its maximal value. This formulation is difficult to use practically because a “closed system” is very difficult to realize experimentally, since it must have constant internal energy, constant volume, and constant amounts of components.</p><p>However, under other conditions (in non-closed systems), one or more intensive variables may be kept constant. If the temperature is kept constant, then the internal energy U is no longer constant, since heat or work has to be exchanged with the sur- roundings in order to keep the temperature constant. The role of being kept constant is thus taken away from U and given to its “conjugate intensive variable,” which is 1/T. Then the function which has a maximum at equilibrium is the state function derived by a Laplace transformation from the entropy by subtracting the product of these conjugated extensive and intensive variables, see for example Callen (1985) or Hillert et al. (1998). This leads to Massieu’s and Planck’s function (Table 2.1).</p><p>In practice another series of state functions, starting with the internal energy U, is preferred. The other members of this series are formed by Laplace transformations using the conjugate pairs of Eq. (2.5). For U the equilibrium condition is formulated as follows: at constant values of entropy, volume, and amounts of the components, equilibrium is characterized by a minimum of the internal energy. Because the sign of this series of functions is defined to be opposite to that of S, VY, or ®, these state functions have a minimum at the equilibrium state. The state variables which have to be kept constant in searching for the minimum are called characteristic state variables. They are given in the last column of Table 2.1.</p><p>A state function in which all the characteristic variables are intensive variables must always be zero. It is called the Gibbs—Duhem equation. At least one extensive variable is necessary in order for us to be able to distinguish the “system” from its surroundings or, in other words, to define the size of the system.</p><p> =========== 12</p><p>2.1.7</p><p>Basis</p><p>Table 2.1 State functions having an extremum at equilibrium, if the characteristic state variables are kept constant</p><p>Name Symbol or definition Characteristic state variables Entropy U v N, Massieu’s function S—U/T 1/T v N, Planck’s function ®=S-U/T—p-V/T 1/T p/T N, Internal energy U Ss V N, Enthalpy H=U+p-V Ss —p N, Helmholtz free energy F=U-T-S T v N, Gibbs energy G=U+p-V-T-S T =p N, Grand potential —p:-V=U-T-S—Y\p;-N, T Vv By; Gibbs—Duhem equation O0=Utp-V-T-S- 1, N, T P H,</p><p>The most commonly used of these functions is the Gibbs energy, G, and, using it, the equilibrium conditions are explicitly specified: in an isothermal isobaric system with constant amounts of all components, the equilibrium is reached when the Gibbs energy reaches its minimal value.</p><p>The function enthalpy, H, is often used in evaluating calorimetric measurements because its change under isobaric conditions is, with few exceptions, equal to the heat received, AQ, if this change is performed in a reversible way. Thus, for isobaric changes of state Eq. (2.4) results in</p><p>ce 2 (=) p =constant @7)</p><p>state 1 T</p><p>Functions of state</p><p>In the preceding section several functions were mentioned. The values of all these func- tions are defined if the “state” of a system is defined. Therefore they are called state functions or state variables. There are two classes of state variables, the “extensive” ones, the values of which are proportional to the size of the system, and the “intensive” ones, which at equilibrium have the same value everywhere inside a system. Extensive state variables include the volume, V, the number of moles, N, the number of moles of com- ponent i, N;, the internal energy, U, the entropy, S, the Gibbs energy, G, and Planck’s function, &amp;. Some intensive state variables are the pressure, p, the chemical potential of component i, j4;, the temperature, 7, and the variable ,/T.</p><p>Extensive variables depend on the size of a system; they must be distinguished from the “integral molar” functions, which are examples of a more general class of functions, namely the “quotients of extensive variables.” These are independent of the size of the system, but, in contrast to the intensive variables, have different values in different phases of the same equilibrium. Examples of this type of state variables or state functions are the molar volume, V/N, the molar Gibbs energy, G/N, the mole fractions x, = N;,/N, the molar entropy, S/N, and the Gibbs energy per volume, G/V. The symbol G initially is reserved for the extensive variable “Gibbs energy of the system” (measured in joules, J).</p><p> =========== 2.1 Thermodynamics 13</p><p>In the literature, however, very often it is used instead of G/N or G,, for the “integral molar Gibbs energy,” which is a quotient of extensive variables and is measured in J mol”.</p><p>Besides the “integral molar” quantities Z/N, there are “partial molar” quantities defined as dZ/AN,, where Z represents any extensive function of state and the partial derivative is taken at constant values of the other characteristic variables. The partial Gibbs energy thus defined as the partial derivative of the total Gibbs energy with respect to the amount of component i, (9G/AN,)y, 7.p: is identical to the chemical potential 4, which is the intensive state variable conjugate to the amount of component i. 4; can also be obtained as the partial derivative of the total enthalpy H with respect to the amount of component i, (0H/AN,)y,s.»» but taken at constant entropy S, p, and Nj (j # i). This, however, is less interesting, because it is difficult to perform an experiment at constant S, p, and N;.</p><p>Gibbs’ phase rule</p><p>The number of independent state variables in a system determines the maximum number of phases that can be stable simultaneously. Gibbs was the first to formulate this and it is known as Gibbs’ phase rule:</p><p>f=ct2-p (2.8)</p><p>where f is the degree of freedom, c is the number of components, and p is the number of stable phases. The number 2 represents the state variables T and p, since they appear as state variables in all thermodynamic systems. If there are types of work other than pV work, for example electric or magnetic work, there are additional state variables and the degree of freedom increases by one for each additional type of work.</p><p>If either T or p is fixed, the 2 is reduced to 1. If both T and p are fixed, the 2 is reduced to zero. Thus, in a system with one component at fixed T and p, just a single stable phase can exist. If T or p is variable, one or two stable phases can exist, and if there are two phases stable the degree of freedom is zero, i.e., this can occur only at a single value of T or p. If both T and p are variable in a single-component system, then at most three phases can be stable and this can happen only at a specific value of each of T and p, and thus is called an invariant equilibrium. For example, the triple point of H,O, at which ice, water, and vapor are stable simultaneously, is an invariant equilibrium. If there are two phases stable in a unary system, the degree of freedom is | and it is called a monovariant equilibrium. Here T can be expressed as a function of p or vice versa, represented as a one-dimensional curve in a diagram. The T—p diagram for pure Fe is shown in Fig. 2.6(a) later.</p><p>Most of the diagrams of binary or higher-order systems discussed below are drawn for a fixed value of pressure and thus the maximum number of stable phases is three in a binary system, four in a ternary system, etc. In an isothermal section of a ternary system, i.e., at constant pressure and temperature, the maximum number of phases is again three. In a phase diagram with potentials (intensive state variables) as axes the degree of freedom defines the number of conditions that can be changed simultaneously</p><p> =========== 14</p><p>Basis</p><p>(at least by a small amount). Thus, for invariant equilibria no condition can be changed, for monovariant equilibria one condition can be changed. In a binary system at fixed pressure the degree of freedom is two only in single-phase regions. In a binary diagram with a potential plotted versus temperature single-phase regions appear as areas and two- phase regions as lines, see Fig. 2.6(b) later. In a composition-temperature diagram the two-phase regions also appear as areas, but the degree of freedom is only one there, as shown in Fig. 2.6(c). This reflects the fact that phase compositions but not phase amounts are counted as variables in Gibbs’ phase rule.</p><p>The degree of freedom is an important quantity when determining the number of conditions necessary to define the equilibrium, as will be discussed in section 2.3.2.</p><p>Statistical thermodynamics</p><p>In statistical thermodynamics the rules of phenomenological thermodynamics are explained as resulting from the mechanics of all the atoms or molecules present in matter. The main topic not included in mechanics itself is the statistical explanation of the entropy. The entropy was explained by Boltzmann as being given by</p><p>S=k-In(w) (2.9)</p><p>where k = R/N, is Boltzmann’s constant and W is the number of different microscopic states leading to the same macroscopic state. The assumptions necessary in order to enumerate W were more clearly specified by quantum mechanics.</p><p>Statistical thermodynamics is the physical background of modeling expressions to describe the Gibbs energy of a phase. The energy terms of the models are usually defined by energies of formation of molecules or building units of crystal lattices. The entropy terms are divided into vibrational terms, which are treated similarly to the energy terms, and entropies of mixing.</p><p>Statistical treatment of vibrational entropy has been used successfully for two topics, the calculation of the entropy of molecules in the gas phase, where the possible states of rotation, vibration, and excitation can be related to spectroscopical experimental data, and to low-temperature heat capacities of solids. The latter are normally not explicitly used in the assessments described here, but appear in integrated form as entropies at the “standard temperature” (298.15 K).</p><p>The entropy of mixing in many of the models in chapter 5 is derived from the following question: what is the increase in entropy due to Boltzmann’s law, if two or more kinds of different atoms are randomly mixed at N fixed places?

Since most thermodynamic data are measured at known temperature, pressure, and composition, it is convenient to choose the Gibbs energy, denoted G, as the basic modeling func- tion.

If the phase composition is inside this spinodal, i.e., det|Q| &lt;0, it can lower its Gibbs energy spontaneously by decomposing into two phases with the same structure but different compositions across a miscibility gap. A “composition-set number” is commonly used as a suffix, e.g., bec#2, to a phase that can be stable with two different compositions at the same equilibrium. In Figs. 2.1(a)-(c) the Gibbs energy, chemical potential, and stability function as functions of the mole fraction of Cr are shown for the miscibility gap in the Cr—Fe system at 600 K, using data from Andersson and Sundman (1987).

In particular, the sublattices defined in the compound-energy formalism in section 5.5.1 have to be related to crystallographic sublattices. The occupation of crystallographic positions by constituents defined in this formalism can have some physical reality only if it has crystallographic reality.</p><p>The terminology of crystallography, insofar as it is useful for the modeling of thermo- dynamic functions, shall be summarized here. It is used in section 6.2.5.5 and chapter 9. For a deeper review of crystallography, the comprehensive treatment by Ferro and Saccone (1996) is recommended.</p><p>Crystal symmetry</p><p>In crystalline solids the atoms are arranged in a “lattice,” which exhibits the same pattern of atoms periodically in three dimensions. Three nonplanar vectors selected in accord with the spatial periodicity define the “unit cell.” Since sums and differences of these vectors are also periods of the lattice, the unit cell is not uniquely defined. The smallest possible unit cell is called the “primitive unit cell.”</p><p>The primitive unit cell is not uniquely defined either, since a parallelepiped with the vectors (@+5), b, and @ has the same volume as a parallelepiped with the vectors @, b, and ¢. The commonly used unit cell is selected according to symmetry. The periodic lattice usually contains a periodic set of “symmetry elements” (rotation axes, screw axes, mirror planes, glide mirror planes, centers of symmetry).</p><p>The number of possible combinations of symmetry elements in a periodic lattice is limited to 230 different “space groups.” The space groups are ordered according to the “erystal systems,” which are defined in terms of the “highest” symmetry element. Also the coordinate system of the unit cell is chosen according to the crystal system (Table 2.2).</p><p>The coordinates given in Table 2.2 do not always allow one to describe a prim- itive unit cell. In the cubic coordinate system, for example, the vectors (@+5)/2, (@+¢)/2, and (b+0)/2 may define a primitive unit cell with one quarter of the vol- ume of the unit cell with three perpendicular equal vectors a, b, and @. This case is called “face-centered cubic” (fcc). After these differences, the 14 “Bravais lattices” are distinguished: primitive cubic, body-centered cubic (bec), face-centered cubic (fcc), primitive tetragonal, body-centered tetragonal (bet), primitive hexagonal, rhombohedral, primitive orthorhombic, body-centered orthorhombic, one-face-centered orthorhombic, all-faces-centered orthorhombic, primitive monoclinic, face-centered monoclinic, and (primitive) triclinic.</p><p>The position of an atom inside the unit cell is given by three parameters, x, y, and z, giving fractions of the unit cell parameters a, b, and c, respectively. The symmetry elements of the space group for any position x, y,z produce images at several other positions, called “equipoints.” For special positions, for example on a mirror plane or on a rotation axis, several of the equipoints coincide. These special positions are distinguished by the Wyckoff notation. The coordinates of all equivalent general and special positions of all space groups are given in the International Tables for X-Ray Crystallography (Henry and Lonsdale, 1965) or can be obtained from the website of the International</p><p> =========== 2.2 Crystallography 19</p><p>Table 2.2.

There are three different notations for the same space group: the “full Herrmann—Mauguin notation,” C 2/m 2/c 2,/a, shows most of the symmetry elements: C-centered Bravais lattice, two-fold axes (2) in three directions, one of them a screw axis (2,), mirror planes (m) and glide planes (c, a) with glide vectors ¢/2 and G/2 perpendicular to the three axes, respectively. The “abbreviated Herrmann—Mauguin notation,” Cmca, shows all symmetry elements necessary to identify the space group. The Schénflies symbol, D3$, is based on the macroscopic symmetry or “point symmetry,” D,,, with the counter “18.” In the “point symmetry” mirror planes are not distinguished from glide planes, and screw axes and rotation axes are treated as equivalent, i.e. only the macroscopic symmetry is taken into account, neglecting details on the microscopic scale of atomic distances.</p><p>The symmetry elements in Henry and Lonsdale (1965) are given by figures and in Table 2.4 all these symmetry elements are tabulated for the space group Cmca.</p><p> =========== 20</p><p>2.2.3 2.2.3.1</p><p>Basis</p><p>Table 2.4 Symmetry elements in space group Cmca, D&#39;s</p><p>Bravais lattice Orthorhombic, C-centered</p><p>Symmetry-center 000 440 404 of4 442 004 Of0 400 atx yes g9 930 953 Gg; G33 473 730 490 Two-fold rotational axis, yz= 00 40 of 33</p><p>Mirror plane, x = 0 +</p><p>Glide plane, b/2. t 3</p><p>Two-fold rotational axis, xz= 14 13 31 33</p><p>Glide plane, 2/2, } 3</p><p>Glide plane, (@+2)/2, y= 0 +</p><p>Two-fold screw axis, x y to 3 th 3s of OF) GE 3 Glide plane, a/2, &lt;= t 3</p><p>Glide plane, 6/2, z= ; 3</p><p>Crystal structures Definition</p><p>A “crystal structure” is described by giving the space group, the lattice parameters (lengths of axes of the unit cell and angles between them), the number of constituents per unit cell, the coordinates of one site of each set of equivalent positions, and the type of constituent occupying each such site. An example is given in Table 2.5.</p><p>The crystal structures form families of (more or less closely) related structures. The main argument of relationship is similarity of the geometry of the coordination of all the atoms by other (like and unlike) atoms. For binary metallic phases a good classification is given in Schubert (1964). A more recent review of crystal-structure classification is the series of three papers by Daams et al. (1992) and Daams and Villars (1993, 1994). It has to be mentioned, however, that the symmetry (space group, Bravais lattice, etc.) does not show these relationships. It may be different for closely related structures and identical for very different structures.</p><p>There exists computer software that can visualize the structures and make understand- ing of the crystal structure and its use for thermodynamic modeling much easier.</p><p>Table 2.5 An example of a crystal-structure description</p><p>PdSn,-type (Schubert ef al. 1959) Pearson symbol: 0C32 Space group: Cmea (equivalent to Bbam) Lattice parameters: a=17l7pm, b=646pm, c=649pm 8 Pd in 8(d) xyz=0.084 0 0 8 Sn in 8(f) 0.17 0.33 16 Sn in 16(g) 0.168 0.33 0.17</p><p> =========== 2.2.3.2</p><p>2.2.3.3</p><p>2.2 Crystallography 21</p><p>Nomenclature of crystal structures</p><p>Several nomenclature systems for the identification of crystal structures are in use. The “prototype” is the name of the phase for which this crystal structure was first determined. The “Strukturbericht” notation gave letters and counters to crystal structures in the sequence in which they were classified. This classification stopped around 1950 and thus this nomenclature does not cover all the crystal structures determined later.</p><p>The “Pearson symbol” is a short description of the structure, denoting the Bravais lattice by two letters (c, t, h, 0, m, a for cubic, tetragonal, hexagonal, orthorhombic, mono- clinic or triclinic; P, I, F, C, R for primitive, body-centered, face-centered, C-centered or rhombohedral) and the number of atoms in the unit cell. Since these two specifications may be the same for different crystal structures, this nomenclature is not unique, but reflects explicitly the most important details of the crystal structure.</p><p>Mineral names very often are uniquely connected with a crystal structure and used as a name for this structure type, like “spinel.”</p><p>In some thermodynamic databases the phase names used for several important crystal structures do not belong to any of the above nomenclature systems. Some of these names are ambiguous. The names fec and bee were initially designated for Bravais lattices (face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic), but they are very commonly used as names for the crystal structures denoted by prototype, Strukturbericht, and Pearson symbols as Cu-type, Al, cF4, and W-type, A2, cI2, respectively. Even derivatives of these structures are sometimes denoted by these two names, although they no longer have the corresponding Bravais lattice. For example “ordered bec” is used for the CsCl-type (B2, cP2) and FeAl,-type (cF16) structures having cubic primitive or face-centered cubic Bravais lattices, respectively; “ordered fec” is in use for the CuAu-type (LI, tP2) and Cu,;Au-type (L1,, cP4) structures having tetragonal or cubic primitive Bravais lattices respectively.</p><p>The nomenclature systems are compared for a few important crystal structures in Table 2.6. A more detailed table is given in Westbrook and Fleischer (1995).</p><p>Sublattice modeling</p><p>The crystal structure of a phase is very important for modeling its Gibbs energy by statis- tical thermodynamics, for example in the compound energy formalism (see section 5.5.1). All atoms in equivalent positions have the same coordination of neighboring atom: Therefore each set of equivalent positions (sites belonging to the same Wyckoff po tion) may be treated as a “sublattice.” This means that, if one of these atoms can be substituted by another one, the whole set of equivalent positions can be randomly substituted. To simplify the thermodynamic modeling, several sets of equivalent posi- tions with similar coordination may be combined and treated as a single sublattice. The contrary, however, namely treating atoms of the same set of equivalent positions differ- ently in the compound energy formalism, is usually not allowed. The chemical ordering, to be described in section 2.2.3.4, does not contradict this rule,</p><p>ince in the ordered</p><p> =========== 22</p><p>2.2.3.4</p><p>Basis</p><p>Table 2.6 Examples for the nomenclature of crystal structures</p><p>Prototype Struktur- Pearson Mineral Other</p><p>bericht symbol names names Cu Al cF4 fec (austenite) Ww A2 cl2 bee (ferrite) Mg A3 hP2 hep NaCl BL cF8 Halite,</p><p>Periclase (MgO)</p><p>CsCl B2 cP2 Ordered bee Cu,Au LI, cP4 Ordered fee CuAu Lly 1P2 Ordered fee Ni,Sn D0j5 hPs Ordered hep CaF, cl cF12 Fluorite MgCu, cis cF24 (Cubic) Laves phase MgZn, cl4 P12 (Hexagonal) Laves phase MgNi, C36 P24 Laves phase Diamond A4 cF8 Diamond</p><p>structure the symmetry is diminished, splitting the set of equivalent positions into dif- ferent ones having also different Wyckoff notations in the space group of the ordered structure. Inside these Wyckoff positions the substitution has to be treated as identical for all sites.</p><p>There is only one exception to this rule: if several atoms of the set belong to a molecule, substituting one of them changes the molecule and may prohibit the substitution of the remaining atoms. For example, if the four O atoms of a SO} ion in a sulfate crystal structure are on equivalent positions, substituting one of them by S gives a thiosulfate ion SO;S?-. Random substitution of the O atoms by S atoms would yield ions with two O atoms substituted, S(S,O,)°~, which do not exist. To describe a solid solution of sulfate with thiosulfate in the compound energy method, the positions of the whole anions SO} and S(SO;)*~ should be treated as single positions forming one sublattice. Similar situations may occur, but less obviously, in other crystal structures with homopolar bondings, such as silicates, carbides, nitrides etc.</p><p>Chemical ordering</p><p>Another feature of crystallography needed in modeling of Gibbs energies is the description of order—disorder transitions, also called superstructure formation. Ordering means in general that a set of equivalent positions, occupied randomly by different atoms, splits into two or several different sets of positions, each preferably occupied by one kind of the different atoms. This is possible only with loss of some of the symmetry elements of the space group that in the disordered state provide equivalence of the positions. This loss of symmetry elements may happen in the following ways.</p><p>e Without changing the unit cell, just losing sets of mirror planes or glide planes. An example is hep with interstitials, space group P6,/mmc, with two metal atoms  =========== 2.3</p><p>2.3.1</p><p>2.3 Equilibrium calculations 23</p><p>in Wyckoff position 2(c), and two octahedral voids in position 2(a), which can be occupied by interstitial atoms. Neither position has any variable parameter. By omitting a set of mirror planes and a set of glide planes the symmetry diminishes to space group P3m1, whereby the position of the octahedral voids splits into the two independent positions (a) and 1(b). The position of the metal atoms in this space group has Wyckoff notation 2(d) with a variable parameter x. If x &gt; 0.25, the voids in position I(a) become larger than those in 1(b) and may be preferably occupied by the interstitial atoms, thus reducing the strain energy. The structure now is called Cr,C-type.</p><p>e Diminishing the symmetry may be accompanied by going to a lower crystal system (cubic + tetragonal, hexagonal &gt; orthorhombic, hexagonal &gt; monoclinic, . .. ). Examples are the CuAu structure and martensite, in which the ordered phase is tetragonal, but derived from a cubic disordered phase.</p><p>e = The primitive unit cell of the ordered phase is composed of several primitive unit cells of the disordered phase. The simplest example is the CsCl-type ordering, in which the cubic unit cell is identical with the primitive unit cell of the ordered phase, but contains two primitive unit cells of the disordered W-type (bcc) phase, although the commonly used cubic unit cell is the same in the ordered and disordered states. A second step of ordering of this type gives the MnCu,Al-type (Heussler phase) or Fe,Al-type, in which the commonly used cubic unit cell (fcc) contains eight unit cells of the CsCl-type, i.e., the primitive unit cell is twice as large as that in the CsCl-type and four times that of the W-type.</p><p>A modeling of chemical order, using some simplifications proposed by Bragg and Williams (1934), is described in section 5.8.4.</p><p>Equilibrium calculations</p><p>Minimizing the Gibbs energy</p><p>In section 2.1.6 various equilibrium conditions were described. Each of these conditions can be used to calculate an equilibrium, but the most commonly used method is to find the minimum of the Gibbs energy G at constant values of temperature T, pressure p, and amounts of components N,. Instead of amounts of the components one may use the mole fractions, x; = N;,/N, of all but the major component and the total amount N = &gt; N;. The usage of these conditions for a calculation needs an analytical expression of the molar Gibbs energy for each phase a, Gé, as a function of these and sometimes also other internal variables such as the fraction of molecules or site occupancies, generally called site fractions or constituent fractions.</p><p>The Gibbs energy may have several minima compatible with these conditions. That with the most negative value of G is the “global minimum” and corresponds to the “stable equilibrium”; the other ones are “local minima” and correspond to “metastable equilib- ria.” They differ in terms of the phases and their compositions present at equilibrium, sometimes only by the compositions of the same set of phases.  =========== 24</p><p>2.3.2</p><p>Basis</p><p>The above conditions do not yet specify which and how many phases are present. Analytical expressions of Gibbs energies, however, exist only for phases and thus an equilibrium calculation can be performed only for selected sets of phases. Thermo-Calc uses the “driving force,” see section 2.3.6, to search automatically to determine whether another set of phases has a minimum with a lower value of the Gibbs energy. In BINGSS it is assumed that experimental equilibrium data are reliable only if the phases present are known. Thus, the calculated value to be compared with an experimental one must be an equilibrium involving just the phases present in the experiment. Of course, finally it must be checked whether, by extrapolation of a phase description, this phase appears to be stable in areas where experimentally it was found not to be stable.</p><p>In chapter 5 analytical expressions for integral molar Gibbs energies of phases, Gf, are given.

The mole fractions x* are definite functions of the site fractions yl”, but the inverse relation may contain additional variables. The amounts of phases, m“, are definite functions of the mole fractions x* and the amounts of components N, = N -x?, expressed by the (generalized) lever rule. The lever rule states that the amount of each stable phase in the equilibrium multiplied by the mole fraction of the component in that phase, summed over all stable phases, must be equal to the overall fraction of the component:</p><p>Yomext (2.19)</p><p>The equilibrium condition may now be written</p><p>min(G) = nin( mG (T, p, x&quot; or yt&quot; ») (2.20)</p><p>The variables m* and x* or yt ” are usually the unknowns, the values of which have</p><p>to be calculated from the conditions of the energetic minimum.</p><p>Equilibrium conditions as a set of equations</p><p>The minimum of Eq.

(2.22) are difficult to use, because then the constraints interrelating the x* and the y\&#39; have to be considered. Eriksson (1971) and Hillert (1981) used the Lagrange-multiplier method to derive a formulation whereby all the variables in Eq. (2.20) are treated as independent. There are three types of constraints: (1) the total amount of each component, N,, has to be kept constant; (2) the site fractions in each sublattice sum up to unity; and (3) the charges of ionic species sum up to zero in each phase:</p><p>Ym® Da Ye? -y?—N, = 0 (all components) (2.23) 7 TF y= 1 =0 (all sublattices) (2.24) ft Ya Y &quot;).y? = 0 (all phases with charged species) (2.25) Te</p><p>Each constraint is multiplied by a “Lagrange multiplier,” and added to the total Gibbs energy in Eg.

Thus, if any of T, p, and N, are treated as unknowns, some other conditions must be set, which are explained in section 2.3.5.</p><p>These equilibrium conditions are used in Thermo-Calc.

In the following, this set will be referred to as “modified Gibbs equilibrium conditions.” They are used in BINGSS, BINFKT, TERGSS, and TERFKT.</p><p>The further modification of this set in the case of a stoichiometric phase a is now easy. Since the mole fractions of a stoichiometric phase are not unknown, Egg. (2.28) are not used and the equation for phase a@ from the set (2.29) is used, because here it is not used up to eliminate 7°.</p><p>For semi-stoichiometric phases, equations intermediate between Eq.

For example, in the ternary system Ca—Si-O, CaO-SiO, is a quasibinary system and, with the components CaO and SiO,, the activity of O, can be set to an arbitrary value, since all phases in the quasibinary system have their oxygen contents determined already by the Ca: Si ratio.</p><p>In “Hillert’s conditions” as well as in the “modified Gibbs equilibrium conditions” the number of unknowns is larger than the number of equations by c +2, where c is the number of components, because, for each unknown, except the c+2 ones N,, T, and p, there is just one equation. This means that the number of degrees of freedom is ¢ +2, which looks like a contradiction to Gibbs’ phase rule insofar as the number of phases is not mentioned. The explanation is that the phase rule is derived from the set of equations (2.21), from which the variables m* and N, have been eliminated and a free change of these variables is not counted as a degree of freedom. For example, a two-phase field in an isobaric binary system is treated in the phase rule as monovariant. Nevertheless, after fixing the single variable 7, the N, still may be independently changed, yielding different m<em>. The success of the phase rule shows that ignoring the variables m</em> and N, in counting the number of degrees of freedom has its advantage. In the above sets this can be done by ignoring the c equations (2.23) or (2.30), respectively, which are the only ones containing the p+ c variables m* and N,. On losing c+ p variables and c equations, the number of degrees of freedom changes to c— p+2, in agreement with the phase rule. This is also a reason why in Eq. (2.26), contrary to Hillert (1981), A“? and Ag are replaced by zr“ and 7 in order to eliminate m* from these equations.</p><p>To calculate a state of equilibrium, for each degree of freedom an independent condition must be added to the set of equations, reducing the number of degrees of freedom to  =========== 28</p><p>2.3.3</p><p>Basis</p><p>zero. These additional conditions and their purposes will be discussed in section 2.3.5. In section 2.3.3 the solution of these sets of equations is described.</p><p>The Newton-Raphson method</p><p>Several methods for solving the sets of equations described in the previous section with respect to the unknowns are known. In Thermo-Calc, as well as in BINGSS/BINFKT and TERGSS/TERFKT, the Newton-Raphson iteration method is used, so this method alone shall be described here.</p><p>It is a generalization of Newton’s method for finding the abscissa, where the value of a function is zero (Fig. 2.2).</p><p>At a starting point x, the function f(x) and its derivative df/dx are calculated. The intersection between the tangent to the function and the x-axis is taken as the next iteration point and the procedure is repeated until f(x) is below a preselected limit €.

This is explained in Fig. 2.3 with the function f,(x) = tanh(x). Starting at x, yields a step far to the right and the following step would be much further to the left. Starting at x,, however, would lead to convergence.</p><p>The function f,(x) in Fig. 2.3 has different solutions for x for the condition f(x) = 0.

X» may give a first step to the vicinity of x, and thus also will result in the solution on the left. This illustrates that the influence of the starting value on the result may be complicated.</p><p>The Newton-Raphson method is the extension of Newton’s method to more than one variable. If, for example, the values of the variables x and y are to be determined, where two functions, f(x, y) and f,(x, y), are zero, Eq.

If a phase has a miscibility gap and its initial constitution is on the “wrong” side of the miscibility gap, the phase may be metastable when it should be stable or may become stable with the wrong composition; see Fig. 2.4.  =========== 30</p><p>Basis</p><p>4500 4000 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 fec 1000</p><p>500</p><p>bec</p><p>Gibbs energy (J mot</p><p>-500 A © 02 04 06 08 1.0 Mole fraction B</p><p>Figure 2.4. The Gibbs-energy curves for two phases with miscibility gaps. If the initial constitution of the phases is on the “wrong” side of the miscibility gap when starting the search for the equilibrium, one may find the metastable equilibrium represented by the upper tangent, whereas the stable equilibrium is represented by the lower tangent.</p><p>Miscibility gaps can occur only in solution phases. For a system in which all phases are compounds with fixed compositions, the equilibrium set of phases is given by the tangent “hyperplane” defined by the Gibbs energies of a set of compounds constrained by the given overall composition and with no compound with a Gibbs energy below this hyperplane. There must be exactly as many compounds in this set as there are components in the system and this equilibrium is “global.”</p><p>There are several minimization techniques that can be used to find the global equi- librium (Connolly and Kerrick 1987, Chen et al. 1993) from a set of compounds; one such has been implemented in Thermo-Calc, also for systems with solution phases. In this case the Gibbs energy surface of all solution phases is approximated with a large number of “compounds,” each of which has the same Gibbs energy as the solution phase at the composition of the compound. The compositions of the compounds are selected to cover the whole surface in a reasonably dense grid, often more than 10* compounds are used for each phase. In a multicomponent system with many solution phases, this may generate more than 10° such compounds. A search for the hyperplane representing the equilibrium for the compounds is then carried out. When this has been found, the compounds in this equilibrium set must be identified with regard to which solution phase they belong to; many may be inside the same phase and Thermo-Cale may then automat- ically create new composition sets. Each compound in the equilibrium set gives an initial constitution of the solution phase, which can be used in a Newton—Raphson calculation to find the equilibrium for the solution phases. This technique of approximating solution phases with compounds can thus be considered as a method by which to obtain good initial constitutions for the Newton—Raphson method and avoid the risk of starting from a constitution of a phase that is on the “wrong” side of a miscibility gap.</p><p>The main limitation of the “global” method is that the conditions for the equilibrium must be such that T, p, and the overall composition are known. If other conditions are used, for example the value of the activity of a component, that a phase should be stable, or that a composition of a phase is known rather than the overall composition, then it is</p><p> =========== 2.3.5</p><p>2.3 Equilibrium calculations 31</p><p>not possible to calculate the global equilibrium directly. However, after an equilibrium calculation according to a Newton-Raphson technique, the overall composition can be calculated and used in a global minimization to check whether the result is correct; if it is not, one can use the global minimum as a starting point for a new equilibrium calculation.</p><p>Conditions for a single equilibrium</p><p>The equilibrium conditions described above as sets of equations contain fewer equations than unknowns. The difference is the number of degrees of freedom f, so f extra equations (conditions) must be added in order to select definitely a single equilibrium. This corresponds, for example, to the selection of a single tie-line from a monovariant binary two-phase equilibrium. In the optimization procedure the “calculated value” corresponding to a measured one is selected in this way.</p><p>One means of selection is by fixing some of the unknowns to given values. This may be counted as diminishing the number of unknowns, but formally it can also be counted as adding an equation of the type “unknown state variable” = “constant value,” for example</p><p>T=1273, — p=101325; =, = 0.1; ~— p; = —40000 (2.37)</p><p>With the constraints Eqs. (2.23)-(2.27) the simplest additional conditions are to fix temperature 7, pressure p, and the amounts of all components N,. For each calculation step, however, it must be selected which and how many phases are present, since Gibbs- energy descriptions exist only for phases. Calculation steps with different sets of phases may be compared. The phase set with the lowest Gibbs energy describes the stable equilibrium.</p><p>If the equilibrium is calculated with a given set of phases, the equilibrium p-values describe a simplex (straight line in binary, plane in ternary, hyperplanes in higher-order systems), as shown in the next section. Whenever another phase has a positive “driving force,” see section 2.3.6, there exists an equilibrium containing this phase, which is more stable than that calculated for the selected set of phases. In the next calculation step this phase must be added. If the calculation finds a negative amount for one of the selected phases, this phase must be removed from the selected set. Phases with miscibility gaps may have more than one driving force at different compositions and this test must be performed separately for each of these compositions.</p><p>In Thermo-Cale this comparison of equilibria of different sets of phases i: automatically. As initial values an arbitrary set of phases is selected, either by explicitly setting starting values or by using “automatic starting values.” In BINGSS and BINFKT the set of phases is selected by the user. Experimental data with undefined phases (for example, a liquidus temperature with undefined primarily crystallizing solid phase) thus cannot be used in BINGSS. For the calculated value to be compared with an experimental one, the phases must thus be determined. A check is necessary only if, in the finally assessed dataset, some phases appear to be stable where they were experimentally found not to be stable.</p><p>done  =========== 32</p><p>Basis</p><p>In the set of equations (2.22) the phase amounts and amounts of components are eliminated. The same is true for the set (2.24)-(2.27) without (2.23). The degree of freedom is that defined by Gibbs’ phase rule and thus depends on the number of stable phases. The elimination of the amounts of components includes the elimination of an overall composition from the equations.</p><p>Instead of just fixing single unknowns, other conditions may give relationships involv- ing several unknowns. By the use of such conditions an overall composition may be re-introduced into the set of equations (2.22).</p><p>A point of the boundary between the a field and the a + field in the isopleth through a ternary system may be selected by adding one of the following two sets of two equations to the six equations of the form of Eq.

(2.39) fix the temperature and give the condition that the composition of @ is on the straight line defined by the two points (1) and (2), which is the abscissa of the isopleth. Thus the abscissa is given by Eqs. (2.38) and the ordinate calculated; with Eqs. (2.39) the ordinate is given and the abscissa calculated. Therefore Eqs. (2.38) are valid for the calculation of a steep boundary, whereas Eqs. (2.39) are well suited to calculate flat boundaries. In BINGSS and BINFKT this can be selected by the user.

The second is obtained by “stepping” one mole fraction of one phase of the three-phase equilibrium across this azeotropic extremum and selecting the equilibrium with maximal or minimal temperature, respectively, in the tabulated output. The third one is just the equilibrium at the fixed overall composition (x, x, x2).</p><p>Generally, boundaries in an isopleth can be found as “zero-phase-fraction” lines. The boundary between the a+ 6+ y and B+ y fields is found by searching for the a+ B+y three-phase equilibrium using Eqs. (2.23)-(2.27) with the condition m* = 0. The N, in Eq.

Most often the driving force is divided by RT and thus rendered dimensionless.</p><p>The driving force is an important quantity in the theory of nucleation of a phase and, as mentioned in the previous subsection, it can be used during minimization of the Gibbs energy to find whether there is another phase that is more stable than the calculated equilibrium set of phases.</p><p>Phase diagrams Definition and types</p><p>If two or three of the conditions mentioned in section 2.3.5 are systematically changed within certain intervals, the resulting two- or three-dimensional manifold of equilibria can be visualized as a phase diagram. Also four-dimensional and “higher-order” phase diagrams are possible, but usually these are represented by two- (or three-)dimensional sections. The largest dimension of a phase diagram is the number of free variables under the equilibrium conditions, for example T, p, and N; in Eq. (2.20), which is two more than the number of components. This maximal number is diminished by one, since extensive variables are represented as relative values by dividing them by one of them, usually N. For example, the amounts of components N, are replaced by the overall compositions  =========== 2.3 Equilibrium calculations 35</p><p>x, = N,/N, the total enthalpy of the system, H, by the molar enthalpy of the system H/N, etc. The variable used as divisor (the total amount N in the above examples) is of interest only as a measure of the size of the system. By keeping one of those relative variables or an intensive variable constant, the dimension of the corresponding phase diagram is again diminished by one. An isobaric binary system thus has two-dimensional phase diagrams.</p><p>A phase diagram differs from a “normal” diagram (called a property diagram here), in which one quantity is expressed as a function of another quantity. In a phase diagram the coordinate axes all represent independent variables and the coordinate space shows the “state of the system,” i.e. how many and which phases are in equilibrium at a selected coordinate point. In a phase diagram also the points between the lines are meaningful; in a two-dimensional phase diagram they describe the existence of a divariant equilibrium. In a property diagram, in contrast, only points on the curve have meaning.</p><p>Lines in a phase diagram nevertheless can be interpreted as functional dependences. Under the condition of monovariant equilibrium of a set of specified phases, one coordi- nate of the phase diagram is an implicitly defined function of the other one. This will be explained in more detail in the next subsection.</p><p>The coordinates as well as the state variables kept constant in a phase diagram must satisfy some restrictions. Hillert et al. (1997a) elaborated the rules regarding possible combinations of coordinates and fixed state variables. From each pair of conjugate vari- ables of a set, Eq. (2.5) or (2.6), one variable must be selected and it can either be used</p><p>as an axis or kept constant.</p><p>Schmalzried and Pelton (1973) classified plane phase diagrams into three types in terms of the type of coordinate axes: a first type with two intensive variables, a second type with an intensive variable and a quotient of extensive variables, and a third type with two quotients of extensive variables. Examples of these types are given in Fig. 2.6.</p><p>The two-dimensional phase diagrams in Fig. 2.6 belong to a unary system, a binary system at a constant value of one intensive variable (p), or a ternary system with con- stant values of two intensive variables (p, T). Similar plane phase diagrams exist for n-component systems with n—1 intensive variables kept constant.</p><p>Lines in phase diagrams represent monovariant equilibria, which in all the diagrams of Fig. 2.6 are two-phase equilibria. The intensive variables are the same for all phases in equilibrium, but the extensive variables differ. Therefore, in diagrams of the first type (Figs. 2.6(a) and (b)), from Fernandez Guillermet and Gustafson (1984) and Coughanowr et al. (1991), respectively, the image of each monovariant equilibrium is a single line. Coordinates, being quotients of extensive variables, represent overall state variables of the whole system as well as individual state variables of the phases. In diagrams of the second and third type (Figs. 2.6(c)-(f)), those of the latter type from Liang et al. (1998), the variables of the individual phases are represented by a pair of lines belonging to the two coexisting phases. Corresponding points on these pairs of lines are connected by straight lines called tie-lines. In diagrams of the second type (Figs. 2.6(c) and (d)) the intensive coordinate is constant along the tie-lines, so they are parallel to the axis of the quotient of extensive variables, whereas in diagrams of the third type (Figs. 2.6(e) and (f)) the directions of the tie-lines are an important part of the information which can be</p><p> =========== Basis</p><p>3000 1400 liquid 1300 2500 liqui 4200 liquid | 2000 g 11005 r 2 © 1000 4 L g fee 3 ® 1500 ® 9004 foc a 8 800 C15 5 1000 5 Fe hop © 700 500 bee 800 500 | 0 400 AX © 8 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Ay ~100 80-60 -40 -20 0 Pressure (GPa) Chemical potential of Mg (kJ mol”) (a) (b) 1400 ° 1300 liquid 1200 14 r ¢ 1100 = -2 fec+C15 © 1000 + ® 900 = -34 L g = E800 ® 700 r 600 CuMg, + hep “5 fee 500 400 6 A o 02 04 06 08 10 A oF 19 15 20 25 30 Mole fraction Mg 1000/T (co) (a) 50 40</p><p>30</p><p>20</p><p>Enthalpy (kJ mol‘)</p><p>TuNig, + hep:</p><p>0 02 04 06 O08 1.0 A °? 02 04 06 08 10 Mole fraction Mg Mole fraction Mg</p><p>©) 0)</p><p>Figure 2.6 Types of phase diagrams: (a) is the T—p diagram of pure Fe, (b) is the T versus Uy diagram of Cu-Mg, (c) is the normal binary phase diagram of Cu-Mg, (d) is the In(xyj,) versus 1000/T diagram of Cu-Mg, (e) is the H/N versus xy, diagram of Cu-Mg, and (f) is the isothermal section of Al-Mg-Zn at 608 K. -  =========== 2.3 Equilibrium calculations 37</p><p>given by the phase diagram. At the points on the tie-lines in the areas between these pairs of lines the quotients of extensive variables represent overall variables of the system only.</p><p>The monovariant equilibria meet in invariant equilibria, where the variables of the phases are represented by points, a single point in diagrams of the first type and separate points for each of the (three) phases in the other diagrams. In diagrams of the second type the three points are ona straight line at the same value of the intensive coordinate, whereas in diagrams of the third type they form a triangle (a tie-triangle). The coordinates of points on the tie-lines or within the tie-triangles represent only overall variables of the system.</p><p>The difference between a phase diagram and a functional dependence may be explained by an example. The functional dependence of the molar volume on temperature can be plotted in the coordinates abscissa = temperature and ordinate = molar volume for a single phase with given composition and at a given constant pressure (for example Vin = (Vo/To)T for an ideal gas). A phase diagram of a unary system can be given in the same coordinates. Here, however, instead of selecting a single phase and taking V,, as a function of T, both T and V,, are taken as independent variables. Thus the pressure as the intensive variable conjugate to volume cannot be freely selected, but depends on the two coordinates temperature and molar volume. The diagram is a typical phase diagram of the second type, showing how many and which phases are in equilibrium at selected coordinate values.</p><p>The coordinates pressure and molar volume cannot be used simultaneously as coordi- nates of a phase diagram, since they are conjugate and thus can replace each other, but they cannot be chosen independently. A functional dependence, however, can be shown for these coordinates, namely the dependence of molar volume on pressure at constant temperature.</p><p>Two-dimensional phase diagrams not covered by the three types of Schmalzried and Pelton are sections through higher-dimensional phase diagrams, cut by a condition relating extensive variables. The most common examples of this type are “vertical sections” of ternary systems (isopleths). In these diagrams the tie-lines usually are not in the plane of section, which means that the extensive values of the phases are not all inside the coordinate space. Owing to that, this type of diagram is often considered not to be a phase diagram, but merely a section through a higher-dimensional phase diagram. This distinction may be of minor importance, since any phase diagram shows only part of the state variables, which are defined by the equilibrium conditions. For example, Fig. 2.6(b) does not show the composition of the phases and Fig. 2.6(c) does not show j-values. Also in isoplethal diagrams the quotients of extensive variables represent overall state variables of the system, which can be interpreted as individual state variables of a single phase only in single-phase areas including their boundaries simultaneously.</p><p>The lines in this type of diagram do not necessarily belong to monovariant equilibria, but have another common feature: they show “zero-phase-fraction” equilibria. All the lines show boundaries between an n- and an (n — 1)-phase field. They can be calculated from the equilibrium conditions for the n-phase equilibrium with the additional condition that the amount of one phase is zero, although still present in equilibrium. This one phase is the phase missing from the adjacent (n — 1)-phase field. Points where lines meet in this diagram can be calculated by setting the amounts of two phas</p><p>s to zero.  =========== 38</p><p>2.3.7.2</p><p>Basis</p><p>Mapping a phase diagram</p><p>Several strategies for the calculation of phase diagrams are in use. One of them, which is called “mapping” in Thermo-Calc, shall be outlined here. Two or three variables of the conditions are selected as axis variables. For each axis a lower and upper limit as well as a maximal step are given. All additional conditions are kept constant throughout the whole diagram. If any of these additional conditions set constraints on mole or mass fractions (or, generally, on quotients of extensive variables), the diagram will be an “isoplethal” section of a full phase diagram. The selected axis variables in the plot are not necessarily those of the calculation of the phase diagram, because, besides the axis variables themselves, all other variables not fixed by the additional conditions are calculated and stored in the raw output. The conditions kept constant, however, restrict the output and thus also the diagrams to be drawn.</p><p>If the fixed conditions constrain only intensive variables, the mapping procedure searches for all equilibria that are monovariant or invariant under these conditions, since only monovariant equilibria appear as lines in complete phase diagrams. In isoplethal diagrams it searches for all zero-phase-fraction equilibria.</p><p>The mapping procedure starts with a single “initial equilibrium,” whereby arbitrary values for the axis variables are fixed inside the selected ranges of the axes. Starting values regarding a selected set of phases and estimated values of the unknowns to be calculated may be given by the user. Otherwise, Thermo-Calc creates automatic starting values. Now the Newton-Raphson calculation is started and, if necessary, the set of phases is changed using the driving forces of all phases considered (those having the status “entered”) until the most stable set of phases and the equilibrium values of all variables are found.</p><p>Now one of the axis variables is changed in a stepwise manner and the corresponding equilibria are calculated until, in the case of non-isoplethal phase diagrams, the resulting set of stable phases corresponds to a monovariant equilibrium. In isoplethal sections the first change of the set of stable phases defines a point of a zero-phase-fraction line.</p><p>In non-isoplethal phase diagrams this monovariant equilibrium is traced, keeping all except one of the axis variables constant and incrementing the condition of the only variable axis in steps until an invariant equilibrium is found or one of the selected limits of the axis is exceeded. The magnitude of the steps of incrementation is controlled by the curvature of the line. At the invariant equilibrium there are initially c+ 1 monovariant equilibria, where c is the number of components. One of them is now traced similarly; the other ones are stored for tracing later. This procedure is continued until all monovariant equilibria have ended at axis limits or at “known invariant equilibria” (meaning those stored already).</p><p>In isoplethal diagrams the zero-phase-fraction line is traced by setting the appropriate conditions: the set of stable phases is constituted by all phases appearing in both areas adjacent to the line plus the phase appearing only in one area; however, this phase is assigned the fixed amount of zero. This tracing is continued until an axis limit is reached or the set of stable phases changes again, i.e., a phase appears on acquiring a positive driving force or a phase disappears on receiving a negative amount. At such a point  =========== 2.3 Equilibrium calculations 39</p><p>always four lines meet, separating the fields of stability of @, O+a, O+a+f and ©+, where @ stands for a set of phases numbering between one and c+2 in a c-component system. Now the other lines starting at this point are traced similarly to the monovariant equilibria in the non-isoplethal mapping procedure.</p><p>The mapping procedure sometimes ends with the message “sorry, can not continue.” This indicates that the Newton—Raphson iteration does not converge. As pointed out in section 2.3.3, this may happen due to bad starting values. Since here the starting values of all unknowns are their equilibrium values in the previous step, this seldom occurs, but there is no way to avoid it absolutely.</p><p>If in a phase diagram a set of lines is completely separated from another set, the mapping procedure must be continued with an additional starting equilibrium leading to the other set. This is likely to happen if a large homogeneity range of a single solid solution extends throughout the whole phase diagram. An additional starting equilibrium may also help to solve a problem with non-converging Newton—Raphson iteration.</p><p>In the Thermo-Calc software, equilibrium values of all variables are stored for each calculated equilibrium during the mapping. This enables one to plot any state variable or function of state variables after the mapping. For example, Figs. 2.6(b)-(e) could all be plotted from a single mapping.</p><p>BINFKT and TERFKT have no automatic mapping procedure. Monovariant equilibria of a selected set of phases are calculated in stepwise fashion along a range of an axis variable, most often the temperature, but also the chemical potential or mole fraction of one of the participating phases may be used as the axis variable. Starting from a boundary system with one phase fewer is supported. In this boundary system (a pure component in BINFKT, a binary system in TERFKT) the corresponding equilibrium is invariant, but the derivatives of the monovariant lines into the system itself can be calculated (Lukas et al. 1982). Invariant equilibria involving a selected set of phases can be calculated easily. Possibly the set of starting values of the unknowns will lead to divergence of the iteration and a different set must be tested.</p><p>These two programs were constructed primarily to calculate diagrams for comparison of calculated with experimental data after a run of an optimization procedure. Thus, for the purpose of calculating phase diagrams from a database, they may be somewhat less user-friendly than Thermo-Calc. Nevertheless, they enable also calculation of com- plete phase diagrams and isopleths through ternary systems. The distinction between stable and metastable equilibria is not made in each calculation step, but there are some final checks allowing one to determine whether the accepted equilibria are the most stable ones.</p><p>A good strategy for BINFKT is to calculate first the two-phase fields starting from the transformation points of the pure elements. Azeotropic maxima or minima are automat- ically found. Then some invariant three-phase equilibria are tentatively calculated. The monovariant two-phase equilibria starting from them can now be calculated. Where two of the monovariant equilibria intersect, an invariant equilibrium must be present, for which now the unknowns are approximately known and can be used as a good set of starting values. Both in Thermo-Cale and also in BINFKT and TERFKT various plots can be generated from the same calculation. In a binary «—T plot a crossing of lines indicates  =========== 40</p><p>2.3.7.3</p><p>Basis</p><p>that a calculated equilibrium becomes metastable there. Thus u—-T plots enable one to check whether the most stable equilibrium has been selected everywhere.</p><p>Implicitly defined functions and their derivatives</p><p>Although the lines in a phase diagram are not intended to show a functional dependence, they can be interpreted as such a dependence for the condition of a monovariant equi- librium. For example, in Fig. 2.6(b) for equilibrium between liquid and the C15-MgCu, phase, the corresponding line shows a functional dependence of the temperature T on the chemical potential of Mg, /44,- Mathematically, this functional dependence is given as an implicitly defined function by the equilibrium conditions, expressed for the two phases selected.</p><p>Since this two-phase equilibrium is monovariant, one additional equation of the type (2.37), namely f4y4, = €, completely defines equilibrium. Now all state variables can be calculated, solving the equilibrium conditions by the Newton—Raphson method. Since the result depends on the value of €, all the state variables, including 7, are implicitly defined functions of € and the calculation yields the function values for the chosen value of é. Also the inverse function, y,(7), can be calculated by selecting a temperature instead of a Mg chemical potential as the independent variable €. In the present case this inverse function has no value above 1074K and two values below this temperature. Thus, to plot the two-phase equilibrium liquid + C15-MgCu, on the phase diagram, it is better to calculate T as a function of jay rather than fy, as a function of T. For other two-phase equilibria the contrary may be true.</p><p>Also in a diagram of the second type, a possible point of view is to interpret the lines as representations of implicitly defined functions. In Fig. 2.6(c) the boundary of the two- phase field C15S-MgCu, + Mg&gt;Cu against C15-MgCu, shows T as an implicitly defined</p><p>MgCuy : -C1S-MgCu we Me as well as the inverse function xy,&quot;°&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;(7). Here it is preferable</p><p>to select T and calculate the value for the inverse function, ove MeCua | but, for example, to calculate the liquidus line of the liquid + C15-MgCu, two-phase equilibrium, it is better to select ayn 4 as the independent variable.</p><p>The concept of implicitly defined functions also defines the derivatives of these func- tions. If the Newton-Raphson method is used for the calculation of function values, it is easy to get also values of the derivatives. To show that, one can assume a set of two conditions f, (x, y, t) =0 and f,(x, y, t) = 0 relating the three variables x, y, and t. These conditions implicitly define the two functions x(t) and y(t). For example, x and y may represent the mole fractions of the two phases of a selected two-phase equilibrium and t the temperature. The conditions f, = 0 and f, = 0 must be satisfied throughout the whole range of variables of the implicitly defined functions. Therefore also their total</p><p>derivatives with respect to t must be zero:</p><p>df, _ af, oh) oh) ana \ax)atly)an?</p><p>dfs _ ah, (a (28)</p><p>function of x,</p><p>(2.45)</p><p>de ar Vax J ar&quot; Vay J ar  =========== 2.3 Equilibrium calculations 4</p><p>or (2) es (wje-# dx } dt dy } dt ot (2) +(#) 2-8 ax } dt dy } dt ot</p><p>The derivatives dx/dt and dy/dt have to be taken over the equilibrium states and thus are the sought derivatives of the implicitly defined functions. The values of these derivatives corresponding to the selected value of the independent variable t can be found by solving Eq. (2.46) as a set of two linear equations for the two unknowns dx/dt and dy/dt.</p><p>Comparing Eq. (2.46) with (2.36) shows that the matrix on the left-hand side is the same as that used to find the corrections to the variables in the last iteration step of the Newton-Raphson method and thus has already been calculated. The right-hand side of Eq. (2.46) consists of the partial derivatives of the conditions f, and f, with respect to the variable t, the independent variable of the implicitly defined functions.</p><p>In this way any of the unknowns of the equilibrium conditions can be treated as an implicitly defined function of another one and values of the function itself as well as of its derivatives can be calculated by the Newton—Raphson method.</p><p>As an example of derivatives, we may derive the famous Gibbs—Konovalov rule</p><p>(Goodman et al. 1981) from Eq.

Mainly the connection with our problem shall be outlined.</p><p>The general problem is as follows: a set of n measurable values W, depends on a set of m unknown coefficients C; via functions F; with values of independent variables x,;:</p><p>W, = Fi(Cj, Xi)</p><p>m (251)</p><p>The index k distinguishes the various independent variables (temperature, concentra- tions, ...) belonging to measurement number i.</p><p>If nis greater than m, it is usually not possible to get a set of coefficients C; for which the W, calculated using Eq. (2.51) are equal to the corresponding measured values L;. Here the criterion for the “best” set C; is that the sum of squares of the “errors” must be minimal, where the “errors” vu; are defined as the differences between calculated, F,, and</p><p>measured, L;, values times a weighting factor p;: (F(Cj Xu) — Li) Bi = (2.52) In many textbooks the square of the quantity p, of Eq. (2.52) rather than p; itself is called</p><p>the weighting factor. Equation (2.52) is called the error equation. The condition for the best values C; is taken as</p><p>=Min (with respect to the C)) (2.53)</p><p>From this condition the m following equations relating the m unknown coefficients C; can be derived:</p><p>j=leem (2.54)</p><p>To solve these equations, Gauss expanded the v, into a Taylor series and truncated it after the linear terms:</p><p>&quot;oy V(Cj Xs) © VC; Xe) +O ac 8G (2.55) ix OC,  =========== 2.4.2</p><p>2.4 Optimization methods 43</p><p>where the AC, are corrections to the coefficients C). If the F;(C;, x,;) and therefore also the v; are not linear in the coefficients C;, this is an approximation, which might not be acceptable if the values of the Cc are too far from the final values of the coefficients.</p><p>To calculate the corrections AC,, Eq. (2.55) is inserted into Eq. (2.54) and, after rearranging, that yields</p><p>Lym (2.56)</p><p>= isl</p><p>™(% ay a) eg ¥(% a, a= Fi</p><p>This is a set of m linear equations for the m unknowns AC,, called “Gaussian normal equations,” which in matrix notation are written</p><p>&quot;av, ay, oy (fxs y. i (Ex), wor((Sez)) em</p><p>These equations are set up, using an initial set C,° of the coefficients, and solved for the corrections AC,. After adding the corrections to the initial set, the calculation may be repeated until the corrections are below a given limit.</p><p>As a measure of the fit between the resulting coefficients and the measured values, the mean square error can be used. It is defined by</p><p>mean square error = &gt; Lam</p><p>(2.58)</p><p>The accuracy of the calculated coefficients is proportional to the square root of the mean squared error. The factor of proportionality of each coefficient is the square root of the corresponding diagonal element of the reciprocal of the left mx m matrix of Eq. (2.57).</p><p>The weighting factor</p><p>In the BINGSS software, described in section 7.2, special care is taken to deal with the fact that, when different types of measurements are used, the errors v, cannot be compared directly. Quantities of different dimensions cannot be added, therefore the squares of errors in Eq. (2.53) should have the same dimension. The weighting factor p, in Eq. (2.52) can be used to make the errors v, dimensionless, if p, is taken as the reciprocal of the estimated accuracy AL, of the measured values (Lukas et al. 1977):</p><p>p= (AL) (2.59)</p><p>If also the independent variables, x,,; (composition, temperature,... of the sample investigated), have limited accuracies, Ax,;, that may also be taken into account (Lukas et al. 1977). In this case the weighting factor p, is defined as</p><p>P= (a + D(A, /dxy,) « as) (2.60) k  =========== 44</p><p>2.4.3</p><p>Basis</p><p>This choice may be interpreted as the v, being dimensionless relative errors defined as fractions of the mean errors of the corresponding measurements. Therefore, the errors of different kinds of measured values can easily be compared.</p><p>The AL, may be estimated from different points of view varying from one series of measurements to another. During the optimization in BINGSS, this can be corrected: for measurements marked by a common label the weight given by Eq. (2.59) can be multiplied by a dimensionless constant factor. This includes the factor “0” to discard a doubtful series of measurements in the following calculations.</p><p>In the PARROT software, see section 7.3, the term added to the sum of squares of errors for each experimental value i is equal to</p><p>( eight, (experimental value); — (calculated value); ) 61) (estimated uncertainty);</p><p>This is equivalent to a combination of Eqs. (2.52) and (2.59) without considering the uncertainties of the independent variables (Eq. (2.60)). The additional dimensionless factor “weight,” is left to the responsibility of the user to assign weights that reflect the relative importance of the data. The default settings of all weights are equal to 1.</p><p>Marquardt’s algorithm</p><p>If all the equations of error are linear in the coefficients, Eq. (2.57) is correct and the final solution should be found in one step. A second or third step may be useful merely due to errors produced by rounding. However, if the equations of error are nonlinear in the coefficients (either due to the analytical description of thermodynamics or due to the error equation) the step after Eq. (2.57) may fail and the mean square of error increase.</p><p>To solve this problem D. W. Marquardt (1963) combined the Newton-Raphson method with the steepest-descent method. The identity matrix multiplied by a factor called the Marquardt parameter is added to the normalized matrix of Eq. (2.57). If the Marquardt parameter is large, this term is dominant and the corrections correspond to a steepest- descent step, in which the length of the vector is the reciprocal of the Marquardt parameter. If the Marquardt parameter is small, the iteration step is nearly the pure Newton—Raphson step. If the mean square error increases, the last correction is discarded and the Marquardt parameter enlarged by a factor (for example 10) and new corrections are calculated using the matrix of Eq. (2.57) of the previous step. If two consecutive steps were successful, the Marquardt parameter is diminished by the same factor for the next calculation.</p><p>There are many other methods of improving the Gauss algorithm for nonlinear equa- tions of error described in the literature. Most of them are mainly intended to diminish the calculation time compared with that of Marquardt’s algorithm or to avoid the analytical calculation of derivatives. Since in our special case the calculation time depends mostly on the calculation of the sum of squares of error, rather than on solving the system of linear equations (2.57), the calculation time cannot significantly be reduced from that of Marquardt’s algorithm. Also the analytical calculation of derivatives is no problem in our case. Therefore no other algorithm is used in BINGSS.  =========== 2.5</p><p>2.5 Final remarks 45</p><p>Final remarks</p><p>In this chapter, diverse topics of science such as thermodynamics, crystallography, numerical methods, and phase diagrams have been mentioned. As stated at the begin- ning, the aim of CT is to make use of experimental and theoretical information from all these topics to formulate a thermodynamic description using for each phase in a multicomponent system a single Gibbs energy function that can describe the equilibrium state of the system. Such a description must, of course, be very approximate and can be improved with new data and better models, but it has already proved to be of great value in understanding, predicting, and simulating chemical processes and properties of materials.</p><p>The thermodynamic description using a single Gibbs energy for each phase means that all thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy, heat capacity, and chemical potentials can be consistently calculated from this. The equilibrium state for a system at given temperature, pressure, and amounts of components, the most common external conditions, can be calculated by finding the minimum of the Gibbs energy, including all possible phases. From the calculated equilibrium all thermodynamic quantities can be obtained, as can, for example, amounts of the stable phases and the partitioning of the components.</p><p>The phase diagram describes the equilibrium state of a system as a function of two or more state variables. For multicomponent systems there are many different types of phase diagrams that can be useful. Any such diagram can be calculated from the Gibbs energy functions and they will all be consistent. The thermodynamic functions can be used for much more than just calculating equilibrium phase diagrams and properties of the stable states. There are no drastic changes in these functions when they are extrapolated outside the stability ranges of a phase. A simple kind of extrapolation is to suspend a phase and calculate a metastable phase diagram from the functions. For example, the metastable Fe-C phase diagram with cementite can be calculated if graphite is suspended.</p><p>By extending this idea further, one can calculate any equilibrium for a phase or an assemblage of phases, irrespective of whether these phases represent the stable state of the system. Of course, the calculated metastable equilibrium is only approximate and the further away from the stable state the less confidence can be attributed to the calculated values of the state variables. However, often the modeled Gibbs energies are the only thermodynamic information available for a metastable state. This use of the Gibbs energy functions requires that the assessment of the stable states be done with great care. The selection of models and model parameters should be made with the intention that the Gibbs energy functions and their derivatives will behave reasonably outside as well as inside the stability ranges of the phases.</p><p>The same rules apply to these metastable equilibria as to the stable one. The only difference is that the total Gibbs energy (for a system at constant T and p) is higher than that for the stable equilibrium. However, it is still a minimum for the phases included in the calculation and the chemical potentials for all components are the same in all phases.</p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="catppuccin-latte">catppuccin-latte</option><option value="catppuccin-frappe">catppuccin-frappe</option><option value="catppuccin-macchiato">catppuccin-macchiato</option><option value="catppuccin-mocha">catppuccin-mocha</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.8.0 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Saturday 14 December 2024 13:26">Saturday 14 December 2024</span>.
