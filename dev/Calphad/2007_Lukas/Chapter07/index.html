id="documenter-page"><p>7.1</p><p>7.1.1</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>In this chapter, two of the most commonly used types of software for optimization, BINGSS and PARROT, are described.</p><p>Common features</p><p>Handling bad starting coefficients</p><p>The definition of the “error” (v; in Eq. (2.52)) is based on the “calculated value” (F,(C;, x,;)). Which is often defined by an equilibrium calculation with two or more phases. The initial set of adjustable coefficients may result in improper Gibbs-energy functions, with which this equilibrium cannot be calculated. As an example, in Fig. 7.1 such a situation is shown for a two-phase equilibrium, liquid + bcc. There GP at all compositions is larger than G4“ and the construction of a common tangent is impossible, so also no equilibrium can be calculated numerically.</p><p>The experimental information is either “at temperature 7, there is a two-phase equi- librium, liquid + bec, for which the composition of the bec phase was measured as (x? = x&#39;)” or “in a single-phase bec sample of composition x’ on heating the first liquid appears at temperature 7,” (see Fig. 4.4).</p><p>In the least-squares calculation for Eq. (2.52) no “calculated value” (F;(C;, x;;)) can be provided as long as the starting values for the Gibbs-energy descriptions of liquid and bee phases behave as in Fig. 7.1. To find better starting values by trial and error is not easy and is time-consuming. Therefore it is desirable to have a method whereby this problem is avoided and that can start even with a very bad initial set of adjustable coefficients.</p><p>Zimmermann (Zimmermann 1976, Lukas er al. 1977) defined the error of a two-phase equilibrium by a linear expression relating the Gibbs energies and their derivatives with respect to the composition x as shown in Fig. 7.2</p><p>dG’</p><p>GH (=x)</p><p>—G&quot; =error (7.1)</p><p>The first two terms together give the point at x” on the tangent to the curve G’(x) at x’. All three terms together thus give the distance between this point on the tangent</p><p>203  =========== 204 Optimization tools</p><p>molar Gibbs energy</p><p>mole fraction B B</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Figure 7.1 At fixed temperature T, no equilibrium between the phases can be calculated with the Gibbs-energy curves in the diagram because the bec phase is more stable than the liquid at all compositions. The experimental information is a tie-line between the compositions marked by symbols.</p><p>molar Gibbs energy</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>mole fraction B B</p><p>Figure 7.2 Construction of the “alternate definition of error.” The difference taken at composition x” between G&quot; and the tangent touching G&quot; at x! is taken to be the “error.”</p><p>and G” = G&quot; at x” = x4. If the single-phase Gibbs energies are linear functions of the adjustable coefficients, the error itself is a linear function of the adjustable coefficients. The thus-defined error is zero if the common-tangent construction fits exactly with the measured concentration x’. In the following Eq. (7.1) will be called the “alternate definition of error.” In contrast to the “normal” definition of the error, using x’ calculated by solving the equilibrium conditions, the alternate definition always has a result, even if the two-phase equilibrium liquid + bec cannot be calculated. There is, however, also a disadvantage: the alternate error depends on x”, which is either just estimated or measured by other, independent, experiments. This may give an incorrect behavior of the least-squares optimization.</p><p> =========== 7.1 Common features 205</p><p>Therefore the alternate definition of error should be used only at the beginning. Mostly then the result is good enough to serve as starting values using the “normal” error, i.e., the error obtained from a normal equilibrium calculation.</p><p>An alternate error can be defined also for other types of measurements. Generally we define it as a linear expression relating Gibbs energies and their derivatives with respect to independent variables that becomes zero if an equilibrium calculation using the current set of adjustable coefficients exactly fits the experimental values. Auxiliary state variables, like x” in the above example, may be used, but should have little influence on the value of the alternate error in the vicinity of the final solution.</p><p>In BINGSS, besides measured T or x’ of a two-phase tie-line, alternate definitions of error are used for measured chemical potentials 4; in two-phase equilibria and for measured temperatures of invariant three-phase equilibria. In</p><p>Gx! —Giex&#39;</p><p>alternate error = — 1, (measured) (7.2)</p><p>G&quot;- (=x) —G&#39;-(1=x&quot;)</p><p>alternate error = — (measured)</p><p>the common tangent is replaced by a line connecting G’ and G” calculated for the compositions x’ and x&quot;, respectively, without specifying it as a tangent. If the optimized Gibbs-energy descriptions of the two phases exactly fit the measurement, this line becomes the common tangent, if also x’ and x” are correctly given. Even if x’ and x” slightly deviate, the line is expected to be very near to the common tangent. For a three-phase equilibrium the common tangent touches all three Gibbs energy versus mole fraction curves. The alternate definition of error in BINGSS demands that “the three calculated Gibbs energies must be on the same straight line” without specifying this line to be a tangent:</p><p>alternate error | = G(x&quot; =x&quot;) 4G&quot; (x — x) 46&quot; (x — 2&quot;) (73)</p><p>In PARROT there is no limitation in definition of the error for each experiment, thus in principle the alternate definition can be chosen freely, too. The PARROT module of Thermo-Cale provides a setting called “set alternate mode,” by use of which alternate errors can be calculated from a “normal” experimental data file as differences of Gibbs energies rather than differences between the measured and calculated quantity. More about that is given in section 7.3 and in the user manual of Thermo-Calc.</p><p>Usage of calculated phase-diagram information during</p><p>optimization</p><p>In optimization by least squares, only single pieces of information are used as experimental data, but it is important to calculate the complete phase diagram several times during the assessment. Such calculations show how the thermodynamic properties interpolate</p><p> =========== 206</p><p>TA21</p><p>7.2</p><p>7.2.1</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>between the experimental points and such calculations may show that some phases appear in regions where they should not be stable. In PARROT it is possible to add as experimental data that a phase should not be stable, as described in section 7.3.7.9.</p><p>Using calculations of metastable phase diagrams and other diagrams</p><p>The temperature—composition phase diagram, T—x, is the normal presentation of metallic phase diagrams and it is common to overlay the calculated diagram with the experimen- tal data.</p><p>It is also useful to calculate metastable phase diagrams if, e.g., all phases except the liquid and the terminal solution phases have been suspended. It may also be interesting to calculate the metastable solubility lines between the liquid and each solid phase including the terminal phases.</p><p>When there are measured values of the chemical potential in two-phase regions, one may calculate T-y diagrams, and add the experimental data to them. With Thermo-Calc, many different diagrams can be plotted using various types of axes in the post-processing of the same phase-diagram calculation. In BINGSS, this type of diagram is particularly useful to elucidate regions where the T—x diagram contains metastable parts, which are not automatically recognized by BINGSS. Calculating the T—y diagram by BINFKT enables one to distinguish between stable and metastable regions of the two-phase fields.</p><p>How to use BINGSS</p><p>General features of BINGSS</p><p>BINGSS is restricted to binary systems. For ternary systems there is a similar program called TERGSS. Quasibinary systems can often be treated like binary systems by BINGSS.</p><p>BINGSS was initially constructed for phases described by the RK formalism, with the assumption that the molar functions of state of a phase are completely determined by T, p, and the mole fractions of the components. Site fractions as used in the CEF and similar variables initially were not used. Later, most of the models defined for binary phases in the CEF were implemented. However, there is now a distinction between cases in which the site fractions are already defined by the mole fractions of the components (for example austenite, the interstitial solution of C in fec Fe) and cases in which one or more degrees of freedom remain when the site fractions are related to the mole fractions. Models in which the number of degrees of freedom is more than one are not implemented in BINGSS. Also pressure dependence is not implemented in BINGSS. Since these cases are not often modeled, most of the binary assessments can be done by BINGSS.</p><p>The equilibrium conditions are used in BINGSS as formulated in Eq. (2.22), with all functions of state formulated as functions of 7, p, and x? (not y/&quot;). The site fractions are related to the x# and a single site fraction is selected as the independent one and called y. They are calculated for internal equilibrium of the @ phase by solving the condition 0G /dy = 0. With the resulting site fractions, all molar functions of state of phase a and</p><p> =========== 7.2.2</p><p>7.2 How to use BINGSS 207</p><p>all their derivatives can be calculated using the concept of implicitly defined functions (see section 2.3.1).</p><p>The data necessary to run the program are collected in two input files, which must be prepared by a text editor before running the program. One of these files contains the analytical descriptions of all the phases, namely the model selected for each of the phases and the selection of which coefficients shall be adjusted and which kept fixed. It has FORTRAN file code 01 and is called “xxxx.coe.” The second file contains the experimental data; it has FORTRAN file code 03 and is called “xxxx.dat.” The name “xxxx” is arbitrary, but must be the same for both files; usually the symbols of the two elements are taken for it.</p><p>Some decisions regarding how to start the calculation and how to continue are either provided in an extra file, FORTRAN file code 04, “xxxx.bgl,” or given interactively from the terminal, if file xxxx.bgl does not exist or is empty. Mostly the program is started with file xxxx.bgl and continued interactively.</p><p>For the data output also two files are used, “store.coe” and “output.Ist.” The file store.coe has the same structure as xxxx.coe, but contains the final numerical values of the adjusted coefficients. If the calculation was successful, it is copied on request to XXXX.coe, overwriting the former file. To avoid overwriting with unsatisfactory results, it is not automatically copied.</p><p>The file output.lst contains information about how the calculation progressed in the various steps. Its content is determined by a variable “LAUF” in file xxxx.bgl or given interactively. By use of the selection LAUF=4 a table can be prepared, giving for each measurement the difference between the measured value and the value calculated with the current set of adjustable coefficients.</p><p>The coefficient file xxxx.coe</p><p>This file is created and modified by a text editor. It is usually prepared as a formatted file using FORTRAN format specifications. Free format (integers, fixed-point real values, floating-point real values, or strings (“abc123xyz”) separated by blanks or commas) is also supported by BINGSS. Lines starting with the symbol “$” are comments and are not used by the computer. Such lines may appear everywhere in the file.</p><p>If the unary systems are elements and their descriptions are taken from Dinsdale (1991), these may be copied from a file called “unary0x.atd,” where 0x denotes the year of the last update. Please check the SGTE website for the latest update. This file contains also templates for all formats of file xxxx.coe. To use these templates most effectively, the text editor should be switched into overwrite (or replace) mode rather than insert mode.</p><p>For quasibinary systems the “quasiunary” descriptions may be taken from the SGTE substance database (Ansara 1999), or from another appropriate source.</p><p>In the first line of the file some dimensions are given. This line is usually edited successively after the corresponding parts are finished. The line looks like</p><p>45 CaMg 3 2 9 1 3000.00  =========== 208</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>The first integer, NP = 4, is the number of phase descriptions in the “excess-term part” of the file. The second integer, NT = 5, is the number of terms used in the “excess-term part” to describe the temperature dependence of parameters according to Eq. (5.2). It is restricted to the six terms explicitly given by Eq. (5.2). After one blank there follow two- character names of the two components. These names are used only for table headings in the file output.Ist, not for the identification of the components. These are identified as components | and 2 in the sequence given here. Therefore this sequence must be kept throughout all the files; it also determines the sign of odd RK terms. The following integers, 3, 2 and 9 are the variables NPREF(1), NPREF(2) and NTU of the following “reference states part.” The integer 1 specifies that Eq. (5.2) is used to describe the temperature dependence of G. Initially another formulation of this equation was used, which was derived from the description of C, by a polynomial in T:</p><p>G=b,—by-T+b;-T-[1—In(T)] — by T?/2—bs -T | /2— bg 73/6 (7.4)</p><p>This description of temperature dependence can be selected by integer 0. Finally, the real number 3000.00 is the maximum temperature for which it is recommended that the dataset should be used.</p><p>The following “reference-state part” contains Gibbs-energy descriptions of the stable phases of the unary systems, called reference phases in the following text. They are functions of temperature after Eq. (5.2), here not restricted to six terms. Also here several different sets of coefficients a; may be used for different temperature ranges. The number of different reference phases is given in the first line for both elements separately as integers NPREF(1) and NPREF(2). Also the maximum number of different coefficients a; is given in the first line as the integer NTU. The description for each reference phase starts with a line giving the number of different temperature ranges and a name. This name is not used by the computer and may be considered as a comment. Then, for each temperature range, depending on NTU, there follow one (NTU &lt; 4), two (5 &lt; NTU &lt; 9), or three (10 &lt; NTU) lines giving the lower limit of the temperature range and the coefficients a;. An example for NTU=9 is</p><p>3Al_(fcc) 298.00 -7.97615000D+03 1.37093038D+02 -2.43671976D+01 -1.88466200D-03 7.4092000D+04 -8.7766400D-07 0.000000D+00 0.000000D+00 0.000000D+00 700.00 -1.12762400D+04 2.23048446D+02 -3.85844296D+01 1.85319820D-02 7.4092000D+04 -5.7642270D-06 0.000000D+00 0.000000D+00 0.000000D+00 933.47 -1.12783780D+04 1.88684153D+02 -3.17481920D+01 0.00000000D+00 0.0000000D+00 0.0000000D+00 0.000000D+00 0.000000D+00 -1.231000D+28 3 Al liquid</p><p>298.00 3.02887900D+03 1.25251171D+02 -2.43671976D+01 -1.88466200D-03 7.4092000D+04 -8.7766400D-07 0.000000D+00 7.933700D-20 0.000000D+00 700.00 -2.71210000D+02 2.11206579D+02 -3.85844296D+01 1.85319820D-02 7.4092000D+04 -5.7642270D-06 0.000000D+00 7.933700D-20 0.000000D+00 933.47 -7.95996000D+02 1.77430178D+02 ~3.17481920D+01 0.00000000D+00 0.0000000D+00 0.0000000D+00 0.000000D+00 0.000000D+00 0.000000D+00  =========== 7.2 How to use BINGSS 209</p><p>The first line specifies three temperature ranges and the name “Al_(fcc),” the next pair of lines gives the lower temperature limit and the nine coefficients a, to dg, the following pair of lines is for the temperature range starting at 700 K, and the last pair is for the range above 933.47K. The last range is the range of the metastable solid above the melting temperature containing the term a) -7~° (Andersson 1985). The following reference phase is liquid Al, containing the term ag- 77 (Andersson 1985) in the ranges below the melting temperature.</p><p>The various reference phase descriptions are identified by integer numbers indicating their sequence in the file. They are counted starting with No. 1 first for the first element and starting again with No. 1 for the second element.</p><p>The following part of the file is the “excess-term part.” It consists of descriptions of each phase of the binary system. For each phase in one line the model is chosen and a name is given. Several models need some stoichiometric coefficients for complete description, which are also given in this line. Finally, the reference states of both elements used in the **G° part of the description of G®, in Eq. (5.1) are selected by two integers from the “reference phases” of the previous part of this file. The following lines give the parameters for this phase as functions of T in accord with Eq. (5.2), using the coefficients a, to ay. The parameters are identified by their sequence, differently for each type of description. For each of these coefficients a one-digit integer is used as a logical variable to decide whether the coefficient will be adjusted during the optimization or kept constant. For a phase described by the RK formalism with terms 1 to t the description of the excess part may be as follows:</p><p>Sphi 1200000021 000000 0.00 0.00000 0.000000 0.000000 0. 0.00000 000000 0.00 0.00000 0.000000 0.000000 0. 0.00000 110000 0.00 0.00000 0.000000 0.000000 0. 0.00000 110000 0.00 0.00000 0.000000 0.000000 0. 0.00000 100000 0.00 0.00000 0.000000 0.000000 0. 0.00000</p><p>In the first line the number “5” means that there are five parameters for this phase; “phi” is the name; and “12” is the code for Redlich—Kister. By this code also the parameters are defined as °G$ —°GN&#39;, °G2 —°GE, OL? ,, ‘LS, and 2L% ,. The following four zeros are reserved for stoichiometric constants and are not used for the RK formalism. The next two zeros are for counting the parameters of a magnetic description (here, 0) and the parameter p (given as integer 1000- p). The next two numbers indicate that for element A the second reference phase is chosen and for element B the first reference phase is chosen, The reference phases correspond to °G&quot;&quot; — HS°® for element i.</p><p>The following lines give the six one-digit integers and six coefficients of the five parameters. Both °G? —°G&quot;™ are zero here. For °L%, and &#39;L® , two coefficients are adjusted and for Lt , only one. The number of coefficients to be adjusted must be less than or equal to the maximum number of coefficients used per line, which is given by the integer NT in the first line of the file.</p><p>For referencing in file xxxx.dat and everywhere else during the calculations, the phases are identified by integer numbers denoting their sequence in the file. There may appear  =========== 210</p><p>7.2.3</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>several different descriptions for the same phase, which in calculations by BINFKT may be used to compare these different descriptions on the same plot using different line styles (dashings or colors).</p><p>In the last part linear constraints relating the coefficients being adjusted can be intro- duced. These constraints are of the form Acoeff = factor: AV,, where V, are the “indepen- dent coefficients” to be adjusted and “factor” means the factor by which an independent coefficient contributes to the coefficient appearing in the formalism of the description. Each “independent coefficient” is identified by an integer and each “coefficient of the formalism” by its line and column number in the “excess-term part” of this file. As an example the correlation of the two coefficients a, and a, of parameter °L (line 3) according to the estimate of Tanaka er al. (1990) with a factor of Ty = 8400 K is shown below:</p><p>13 1 8.40000000D+03 1 3 2-1.00000000D+00</p><p>The file is finished by a line containing only zeros and blanks. Behind that line comments may be added. A set of items useful for complete documentation is given in the file “unary.atd.” It is strongly recommended that all these comments be added, as long as they are available without needing to search for them again in old protocols.</p><p>The experimental data file xxxx.dat</p><p>The file containing the experimental data, xxxx.dat, must be created in parallel to the xxxx.coe file. The sequence of the components and the numbering of the phases must be common to xxxx.coe and xxxx.dat. That must be decided before starting to construct the files.</p><p>Each experiment must be completely described by the FORTRAN variables NTYP, NPHA, ITU(1) to ITU(4), W2DW, T£DT, TT, DTT, and X(1) to X(6), some of which are not used for some types of experiments. The experiments are classified into types by NTYP and NPHA, where NTYP distinguishes between partial Gibbs energies of element A (1) or B (2), enthalpy differences between single-phase samples at the same temperature (3) or different temperatures (4, 12), enthalpy differences between two-phase equilibrium samples (5), entropy differences (9, 10, 11), phase-diagram mole fractions (6) or temperatures (8), equilibrium phase amounts (7), equilibrium mole fractions at isopiestically given chemical potentials (14, 15), or site fractions of a species on a sublattice (13). NPHA gives the number of phases involved in the experiment. Reference states need not be counted in NPHA, although they must be specified as phases. The array ITU(|) identifies the phases including the reference states. W++DW is the measured value in SI units. T£DT and, if necessary, TT are temperatures in kelvins. If TT is used, DTT describes the accuracy of (T—TT), not of TT itself. The X(I) are mole fractions.</p><p>Experiments are classified into standard types, for which the equations of error (Eg. (2.52)) are summarized in Table 7.1. This classification covers nearly all possible experiments giving quantitative information connected with thermodynamic functions, except pressure dependence. Which of the above variables are used and their specific meanings depend on NTYP and NPHA, as summarized in Table 7.2.</p><p> =========== 7.2 How to use BINGSS 211</p><p>Table 7.1 Equations of error related to binary experimental data</p><p>Type IVERS Calculated value ~ measured value 1 1 All Hy —°GT =, 1 2 13,567 Gx&quot; (x) + Gx! /(x — 2x&quot;) — GP = py 1 22489 wily —°G — wy 2 1 All 1) —°GS! — py 2 2 1,3,5,6,7 Gi Wier 2&quot;)4G-(a&quot; = D/la&quot; x) °F 2 2 24,89 Mae —°GS! — by 3 1 All H&#39;(T) — (1-x&#39;)- HT) x HE (T) — 3 2 All H&#39;(T)—H&quot;(T) — 3 3.

Usually several calculations are necessary in order to get the values for the variables in the file from the data reported in a publication, such as transformations from mass fractions to  =========== 7.2 How to use BINGSS 213</p><p>mole fractions or changing units to SI units. To facilitate this, a program called BINDAT was written.</p><p>This program is constructed so that one need enter only once data that usually are equal throughout a set of measured values, thus minimizing the input for a single value to the few numbers characteristic for this value. Values that are equal only for a subseries may be prompted intermediately. Because of the manifold different ways to report data of the same kind, this idea may turn out not to be used 100% consequently. At each level of (sub)series a condition is prompted, by which the program switches to the previous level. This condition is an input that is impossible for the variables prompted, namely a “phase number” zero, a “mole fraction” outside the range 0-1, or a “temperature” below 0K.</p><p>For the accuracies of the measurements a standard estimation procedure is used. The estimated accuracy of each value is additively composed of a part proportional to the value and of a constant part, v = v+ Av, with Av = v- DWP + DWA. The constant part reflects the minimum quantity detectable by the method applied and the proportional part reflects the usual trend that the inaccuracy of large measured quantities increases proportionally to the quantity itself. The factor of proportionality as well as the constant part are given once for a series of measurements. The accuracy of mole fractions is estimated similarly. Since a mole fraction near unity corresponds to a small mole fraction, the proportional part is taken as a fraction of (1 —x)-x rather than as a fraction of the mole fraction x itself. Since the maximum of (1 — x) -x is 1/4 in this context, this fraction is multiplied by 4 in order to make the maximum estimated inaccuracy equal to the factor plus the constant value given by x = x+ Ax with Ax = x-(1—x)-DXP+ DXA. For the accuracy of the temperature only a constant value AT = DT is estimated. For the variables DWP, DWA, DT, DXP, and DXA default values of 0.05, 0.0, 5.0, 0.004, and 0.001 are proposed. It is necessary to estimate these accuracies to be equal for experimental data of similar quality, even if the accuracies given in the papers are different. If all the values of the inaccuracies were changed by the same factor, this would not change the result of the least-squares calculation, since it is just equivalent to a change of meaning of the inaccuracies, for example from a mean error to a limit of the 99% confidence range.</p><p>Since equivalent values may be reported differently in the literature, besides the variables NTYP and NPHA a third variable ISELEC is used to select the proper type for a series of measured values. For each series a two-character label is requested. This label in BINGSS is used to change the weighting by multiplying it by a dimensionless factor (including zero for omitting this series). In BINFKT the label is used to select different symbols for plotting the measured points. Therefore, if data of the same kind and the same origin might need to be distinguished later, they should be compiled as different series with different labels.</p><p>During the interactive input to BINDAT all the data input is collected into a file called yyyy.out. This file may be renamed to yyyy.bin and BINDAT can be executed again, using this file as input rather than interactive input. Typing errors may be corrected and new values added to yyyy.bin by a text editor. The formatted experimental data file appears as file yyyy.app. Several of these files with different names “yyyy” may be merged by a text editor to give a single file “xxxx.dat.”  =========== 214</p><p>7.2.3.2</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>An example of running BINDAT</p><p>Starting BINDAT gives the following messages on the screen (the first two questions are answered by “0” and “MgY”, respectively):</p><p>Give: from terminal (0) from file 01=&quot;sys&quot;.bin (1)</p><p>Give: 2 element names (2 characters each without blank between and before) MgY</p><p>Give: LABEL, NTYP, NPHA, ISELEC</p><p>NTYP = 0: Stop =</p><p>LABEL: 2 characters without blank before</p><p>NTYP=lor2, NPHA=lor2, ISELEC=1: my (emf, RTlna,..) lor2 lor2 2: my asA+BT+CT1nT lor2 lor2 3: vapor pressure by dew point lor2 lor2 4or 5: like 1...2, but excess my lor2 lor2 6: activity NTYP = 3, NPHA = 1, ISELEC = 1: H(mix) or H(form) NTYP=3o0r4, NPHA=2, ISELEC = 1: Delta-H of two phases 4 2 2: Cp-values NTYP = 3,4 0r12,NPHA=3o0r4, ISELEC = 1: Enthalpies of mixing (series) 3 3 2: partial enthalpies 3 3o0r4 3: Series, reported as H(mix) NTYP=6o0r8, NPHA=2or3, ISELEC=1: phase diagram 6or8 1 1: for plot by BINFKT only LABEL Comment</p><p>0 000</p><p>This is a short list of all the types of experiment implemented in BINDAT and their usual descriptions in the literature.</p><p>The most effective way of running BINDAT is to give interactively some few values and interrupt the program as done here by giving four items “0 0 0 0” with 0 for NTYP.

Other integers define a mixture of alternate and normal mode, which sometimes is useful in intermediate steps. The corresponding equations of error are given in Table 7.1.</p><p>e  IALGOR selects between Gauss (1) and Marquardt (2) algorithms. Usually the Marquardt algorithm is selected.</p><p>e NMAX gives the number of complete runs of the optimization algorithm before the next prompt asks for continuation.</p><p>e NOTAUT gives the number of different “labels” for which the weighting defined by Eq. (2.60) is multiplied by a dimensionless factor.</p><p>e NOTPHA: to improve convergence, some phases may be suspended during the first optimization steps, this integer declares how many.</p><p>e EPS is a convergence criterion. If the corrections of all coefficients are smaller than the absolute value of the coefficient times EPS, the calculation is defined to have “converged” and stops.</p><p>¢ PMARQ is the Marquardt parameter (see section 2.4.3). It is decreased by a factor of 10 after each successful step and increased by a factor of 10 after each diverging step.</p><p>The following line is formatted. It contains NOTAUT groups of a four-digit integer (0 to 9999) and a two-character label. The weighting of the values in xxxx.dat marked  =========== 218</p><p>7.2.5</p><p>7.2.6</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>by this label is multiplied by this integer taken as percent. There may be eight such groups in the line, up to three lines. If NOTPHA is not zero, there follows a line defining the phases to be suspended by three-digit integers (numbers defined by the sequence of phase descriptions in xxxx.coe).</p><p>In the above example the following line gives LAUF = 9 and thus switches to interactive input.</p><p>Plotting of diagrams for comparison with experimental data</p><p>The result of an optimization must be checked by comparing all experimental data with the corresponding values calculated using the optimized dataset. This is usually done by plotting diagrams.</p><p>For this purpose the program BINFKT is provided in the BINGSS package. It enables one to calculate tables and to produce plots of molar functions of state of single phases versus temperature or mole fraction, of invariant equilibria (three-phase equilibria or azeotropic points of two-phase equilibria), or of two-phase equilibria between two selected temperatures. “Mapping” of phase diagrams is not provided. All equilibria are calcu- lated between specified phases irrespective of whether they are the most stable ones. This allows plotting of metastable two-phase equilibria. BINFKT also enables one to introduce experimental data compiled in the file xxxx.dat into various types of suitable diagrams.</p><p>To check the stability ranges by use of BINFKT, the calculation of T versus jz; plots is recommended (two-phase equilibrium chemical potentials</p><p>BINFKT uses the same files as BINGSS, namely xxxx.coe and xxxx.dat, as well as an extra file called xxxx.bfl defining all the tables and curves to be calculated. This file may be created by running BINFKT interactively, but usually it is easier to take an existing such file as template and create xxxx.bfl by use of a text editor.</p><p>Some differences from PARROT</p><p>BINGSS cannot be used for ternary or higher-order systems.</p><p>BINGSS has some restrictions regarding the usage of less-common models. BINGSS has built-in equations of error for most types of experimental data. BINGSS can start an optimization with all parameters set to ZERO without any extra preparation of the experimental data used (start with IVERS = 1). If only models in which the number of independent site fractions does not exceed the number of independent mole fractions are selected, this guarantees convergence in very few steps. This procedure creates a set of starting values that will usually give the final optimization in a few steps.</p><ol><li>BINGSS outputs a complete list of final errors (differences between calculated and</li></ol><p>measured values) on request (LAUF = 4).</p><p>Pey»e  =========== 7.3</p><p>7.3.1</p><p>7.3 The PARROT module of Thermo-Calc 219</p><p>The PARROT module of Thermo-Calc</p><p>With the program PARROT, which is part of the Thermo-Calc software system, one can fit thermodynamic model parameters to all kinds of experimental information that can be measured at an equilibrium, stable or metastable. Any kind of model parameter can be optimized, including magnetic and pressure-dependent parameters, in all models that have been implemented in the Gibbs Energy System (GES), which is also a part of Thermo- Calc. A special version of PARROT, not described here, can also optimize mobilities and activation energies for diffusion.</p><p>PARROT is not limited to binary systems but can handle experimental information for systems with up to twenty components. In practice systems with more than five components have never been used in an assessment and in most of those cases binary and ternary parameters only were adjusted or added to fit the multicomponent information.</p><p>PARROT is a fully interactive program. It is possible to give all information about the system to be assessed directly from the keyboard to the program, but it is recommended that the user start by creating a number of text files for data and commands, of which the most important are the setup file and the experimental data file. PARROT has a main module for manipulating the optimizing conditions and a special EDIT-EXPERIMENT module for manipulating each individual experimental equilibrium.</p><p>This chapter does not replace the user’s guide, which is available together with the software, but it contains practical advice based on experience and will convey the flavor of the system. The user must be aware of the fact that it is his own judgment that is critical. The software is only a tool for trying out various options of model selection and weighting of experimental data. It requires a user with a good understanding of thermodynamics and phase diagrams and some experience of modeling.</p><p>The optimization method</p><p>For equilibria for which all independent state variables are determined with negligible inaccuracies, the criteria for the best fit, derived from the maximum-likelihood principle, will be minimum in the sum of squares of weighted residuals. Inaccuracies in experimental conditions can be taken into account in two ways in PARROT.</p><ol><li>The inaccuracies in conditions, i.e., independent state variables, can be prescribed</li></ol><p>in the POLY-3 interface. In this case an equilibrium will be calculated with the experimental values of independent state variables. The standard deviations of the dependent state variables will be calculated by use of the error-propagation law, presuming linear dependences of the dependent state variables on the independent state variables.</p><ol><li>The “true” value of the condition can be optimized by using one of the defined</li></ol><p>variables as the condition. This can be obtained by the IMPORT command in the experimental data file. In this case the experimental observations of the independent state variable should be specified in the EXPERIMENT command in the experimental</p><p> =========== 220</p><p>7.3.2</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>data file. The commands that can be used in the experimental data file are a subset of the commands available in the POLY-3 module, with a few extensions.</p><p>Both methods can be transformed to the problem of finding the minimum of the sum of squares. Method 2 can be used when several experiments have been performed under the same, badly determined, conditions. The two methods can be mixed in the same optimization run.</p><p>The set of adjustable coefficients, in PARROT called variables, that give a minimum of the sum of squares is found by a numerical subroutine called VAOSA from the Harwell Subroutine Library.</p><p>The use of PARROT</p><p>The assessor should prepare a number of files that will be used during the assessment. These will be briefly described here. They are</p><p>POP file with experimental data,</p><p>SETUP file with models and known and unknown parameters, EXP file with experimental data to be plotted, and</p><p>MACRO files for quick calculation of various diagrams.</p><p>These files will be described below in more detail. A simple description of the flow of the assessment work would be as follows.</p><ol><li><p>Prepare the SETUP and POP and EXP files with a text editor (not a word processor!).</p></li><li><p>Start PARROT and run the SETUP file once to create the work file, usually called</p></li></ol><p>the PAR file since its extension is “.PAR.” The PAR file is machine-dependent and cannot be read by a text editor. It can be manipulated only through the PARROT module. The PAR file will always contain the last results and is automatically updated whenever it is used in PARROT. Whenever a user wants to “freeze” a reasonable set of model parameters but perhaps continue trying to change the weightings or set of model parameters, it is advisable to make a copy of the PAR file.</p><ol><li>COMPILE the POP file inside the PARROT module. The experimental data will</li></ol><p>be stored on the PAR file.</p><p>Select which variables to optimize.</p><p>SET-ALTERNATE-MODE ON and optimize all equilibria until they have con-</p><p>verged.</p><p>RESCALE the variables to set the start values to the final values.</p><p>Optimize and rescale until no more changes occur.</p><p>SET-ALTERNATE-MODE OFF.</p><p>Calculate diagrams and compare the results with experimental data. This should</p><p>be done whenever needed during the steps below also. The sum of errors is not a</p><p>sufficient measure of the overall fit. You may find it convenient to make MACRO</p><p>files to calculate several diagrams.</p><p>ws</p><p>eo enn  =========== 7.3.3</p><p>7.3 The PARROT module of Thermo-Calc 221</p><ol><li>Use the EDIT-EXPERIMENT module to COMPUTE-ALL equilibria. Some equi-</li></ol><p>libria might not converge or may converge to results far away from the experimental data. Some hints on how to handle that are given below. Experimental data that cannot be calculated should have SET-WEIGHT zero. SAVE when finished with the EDIT module.</p><ol><li>Optimize the variables zero times and check the errors carefully, using the LIST-</li></ol><p>RESULT command. This output gives an overview of the current fit to all experi- mental data.

You may</li></ol><p>find that some variable becomes very large or very small. That may be due to a lack of experimental information. You may have to increase or decrease the number of optimized variables and also use the EDIT module to select the weightings of the various experimental equilibria until you get reasonable results.</p><ol><li>You may have to optimize “in parts,” keeping the variables for some phases fixed</li></ol><p>and optimizing others with respect to selected sets of experimental data. The selec- tions of experiments are made in the EDIT module.</p><ol><li>You may have to iterate several times through all points above, even editing the</li></ol><p>POP and SETUP files, before you are satisfied. You may try various models for the phases and various numbers of variables for each phase.</p><ol><li>A final optimization with all variables and all experiments with their selected</li></ol><p>weightings should be carried out.</p><ol><li>Write the report. When you do this, you may find that you cannot explain some</li></ol><p>decisions made during the optimization; and you may have to go back to optimize and try various new options.</p><p>The experimental data file, the POP file</p><p>The experimental data on a system, taken from the literature or measured by the assessor, should be written onto a file called a “POP” file (because the default extension is .POP). The experimental equilibria and measurements are described with POLY commands, with some additional features. The commands that are legal in a POP file are described in a special section of the POLY manual. It is very important to understand the state-flexible variable notation used in POLY and PARROT.</p><p>The POP file is a very important form of documentation because it describes the known experimental data for a system. The POP file is intended to be self-documenting and readable both to a human and to the computer. The experimental data are described independently of the models selected for the phases. It is thus possible to use the same POP file to assess a system using different models for the phases. It is not uncommon that a system must be reassessed some years later when new information is available, or if a model for a phase should be changed. Since the reassessment may be done by someone other than the person who created the POP file, it is important that the information in the POP file is well organized and documented.  =========== 222</p><p>7.33.1</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>The recommended way to specify an experimental equilibrium is to document as closely as possible the actual experimental conditions. Usually the set of stable phases is known and also the temperature, pressure, and some or all compositions. We will now describe how to enter some typical experimental data.</p><p>Single-phase experiments</p><p>Experiments with a single stable phase most often concern enthalpies of mixing or chemical potentials. As an example, the following describes an experiment on the Au-Cu system:</p><p>CREATE-NEW-EQUILIBRIUM 1 1</p><p>CHANGE-STATUS LIQUID=FIX 1</p><p>SET-CONDITION T=1379 P=1E5 X(LIQUID,AU)=0.0563 SET-REFERENCE-STATE AU LIQ * 1E5</p><p>SET-REFERENCE-STATE CU LIQ * 1E5</p><p>COMMENT Measurement by Kopor and Teppa, Met, Ann. Phys. 1927 p 123 LABEL ALH</p><p>EXPERIMENT HMR=-1520:200</p><p>GRAPHICS 5 1379 -15201</p><p>The first five commands in this example are standard POLY commands described in the user’s guide, but the first command, CREATE, is rarely used in POLY and may deserve some comments. Each experimental equilibrium must start with the CREATE command and the first integer given after the command is a unique identifier that is later used interactively to set weightings, for example. The second integer is an initialization code; 0 means that all components and phases are initially suspended, 1 means that all components are entered but all phases suspended, and 2 means that all components and phases are entered initially.</p><p>The last four commands, COMMENT, LABEL, EXPERIMENT, and GRAPHICS are available only for the POP file and in the EDIT-EXPERIMENT module. EXPERIMENT specifies the quantity to be fitted by the optimization. The syntax of this command is similar to that of the command SET-CONDITION. It is followed by a state variable or a function name and a value and an uncertainty. The EXPERIMENT command is described in detail in the section of the POLY command manual about the EDIT-EXPERIMENT module.</p><p>The command COMMENT is followed by a text that will be saved in the work file of the optimization. One may also give comments after a dollar sign, “$”, but these comments are lost when the experimental data file is compiled; see section 7.3.7.1.</p><p>The command LABEL provides a way to specify a set of equilibria that the user wants to treat as one entity when setting weightings. A label can have at most four characters and must start with the letter A.</p><p>The command GRAPHICS can be used to create automatically an experimental data file, the EXP file, when the POP file is compiled. This is a new feature from version P of Thermo-Calc. Read the documentation in the Thermo-Cale manual to understand  ===========</p><p>7.3.3.3</p><p>7.3 The PARROT module of Thermo-Calc 223</p><p>this file format. The first integer after the command is the dataset number; the next two numbers are the horizontal and vertical coordinates, respectively. The final integer is the symbol to plot.</p><p>Two-phase experiments</p><p>Most experimental information, for example from the phase diagram, involves two or more phases. For example, the melting temperature of an Au—Cu alloy can be described as follows:</p><p>CREATE-NEW-EQUILIBRIUM 1 1</p><p>CHANGE-STATUS PHASE FCC=FIX 1 CHANGE-STATUS PHASE LIQUID=FIX 0 SET-CONDITION X(FCC,CU)=0.14 P=1E5 EXPERIMENT T=970:2</p><p>COMMENT H E Bens, J Inst of Metals 1962 p 123 LABEL ALS</p><p>GRAPHICS 1 0.14 970 2 SET-ALTERNATE-CONDITION X(LIQUID,CU)=0.16</p><p>All commands except the last have been described above. The last command specifies an estimated value of the liquid composition at the equilibrium. This command is not necessary except during the alternate-mode calculation described in section 7.3.7.3.</p><p>Note that the information in this case was the temperature. One could equally well describe the same melting point with the temperature as condition and the composition as experimental information because both are measured quantities. The selection of quantities used as conditions should be based on the experimental technique. Those known with the least accuracy should be used as experimental data.</p><p>Experiments on invariant equilibria</p><p>It is a peculiarity of PARROT that invariant equilibria are the most important experimental information to be provided for an assessment. It is thus advisable to have all invariant equilibria for a system on the POP file, even if some of them have not been measured explicitly. A reasonable estimate from the available experimental data can often be sufficient, but one should be careful using phase diagrams drawn when there is little data to limit the imagination of the artist. At the end of the assessment such estimated equilibria should be excluded, but they are very useful for obtaining a set of initial values for the model parameters. An example of a three-phase equilibrium in a binary system follows:</p><p>CREATE-NEW-EQUILIBRIUM 1 1 CHANGE-STATUS PHASE FCC BCC LIQUID=FIX 1 SET-COND P=1E5</p><p>EXPERIMENT T=912:5  =========== 224</p><p>7.3.34</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>SET-ALTERNATE-CONDITION X(FCC,B)=0.1 X(BCC,B)=0.4 X(LIQ,B)=0.2 LABEL AINV</p><p>COMMENT Estimated compositions</p><p>GRAPHICS 1 0.19123</p><p>GRAPHICS 1 0.2 9123</p><p>GRAPHICS 1 0.4 9123</p><p>The alternate conditions are needed only for alternate-mode calculations. Another example of an invariant equilibrium is a congruent transformation when the composition of both phases is the same (but may be unknown):</p><p>CREATE-NEW-EQUILIBRIUM 1 1 CHANGE-STATUS PHASE BCC LIQUID=FIX 1 SET-COND P=1E5 X(BCC,B)-X(LIQ,B)=0 EXPERIMENT T=1213:10 SET-ALTERNATE-CONDITION X(B)=0.52 LABEL AINV</p><p>COMMENT Estimated compositions GRAPHICS 1 0.52 1213 2</p><p>With some experience from phase-diagram evaluation, it is possible to estimate metastable invariant equilibria. In particular, such estimated metastable equilibria are useful to reduce the number of phases to be assessed simultaneously. One may, for example, assume that a certain intermediate phase does not form and extrapolate the liquidus curves below the stable three-phase equilibrium and estimate temperatures and compositions of metastable three-phase equilibria between two other phases and the liquid.</p><p>Another useful technique is to extrapolate a liquidus line from a peritectic equilibrium to estimate the congruent melting temperature of the compound that melts peritectically.</p><p>Ternary and higher-order experiments</p><p>PARROT can handle optimization of ternary or higher-order information in the same way as binary. The only thing to note is that one more condition is needed for each component added. In practice quaternary and higher-order information is used mainly to optimize binary or ternary parameters. In ternary systems it may be more important to use the feature that one may have uncertainties also on conditions. A tie-line in a binary system is determined if the two phases, the temperature, and the pressure are known and the composition of one of the phases has been measured. For a tie-line in a ternary system, one must have measured at least two compositions, which often have the same uncertainty. One may then assign an uncertainty to the composition selected as condition. For example,</p><p>CREATE-NEW-EQUILIBRIUM 1 1 CHANGE-STATUS FCC BCC=FIX 1 SET-CONDITION T=1273 P=1E5 X(FCC,B)=0.1:0.02  =========== 7.3.3.5</p><p>7.3 The PARROT module of Thermo-Calc 225</p><p>EXPERIMENT X(FCC,C)=0.12:.02</p><p>LABEL AFB</p><p>SET-ALTERNATE-COND X(BCC,B)=0.17 X(BCC,C)=0.07 GRAPHICS 10.10.12 2</p><p>GRAPHICS 1 0.17 0.073</p><p>The alternate conditions will be explained in section 7.3.7.3.</p><p>One problem with binary assessments is that the experimental information can often be described almost equally well by very different sets of model parameters. It is often the extrapolation of these assessments into ternary systems that gives decisive information about which set of model parameters is the best. Sometimes information from several ternary systems may be needed in order to decide on the best description of a binary system.</p><p>Simultaneous use of binary and ternary experiments</p><p>PARROT allows simultaneous optimization of binary and ternary (and higher-order) information. By using the CHANGE-STATUS COMPONENT command, one may have experimental data from binary and ternary systems on the same POP file. Note that it is not good technique to set the fraction of a third component to zero for binary experimental information. The CHANGE-STATUS COMPONENT C=SUS is fragile, however, and may need manual setting for it to work properly. An example of a binary three-phase equilibrium in a ternary system is</p><p>CREATE-NEW-EQUILIBRIUM 1 0 CHANGE-STATUS COMPONENT A B = ENTERED CHANGE-STATUS PHASE FCC BCC LIQ=FIX 1 SET-COND P=1E5</p><p>EXPERIMENT T=1177:10</p><p>LABEL AAB</p><p>COMMENT from A-B system</p><p>Note the use of initialization code 0 in the CREATE-NEW-EQUILIBRIUM command. This means that all components must be entered.</p><p>Experimental data given as inequalities</p><p>For some experimental data one does not know the actual value, just that it must be lower or higher than a certain value. It is possible to use such information in the POP file by using “&gt;” or “&lt;” instead of the equals sign in EXPERIMENT. The number after the colon in a factor for the “penalty function” specifies how big the error should be if the value is on the wrong side of the inequality. The smaller the number the quicker the error will rise. The inequality experiment is useful, for example, when a phase appears where it should not be stable, see section 7.3.7.9, but also in other cases, for example when a temperature or composition is not known, but it is known that it should be below or above a certain value.  =========== 226</p><p>7.34</p><p>7.3.5</p><p>7.35.1</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>The graphical experimental file</p><p>For plotting calculated diagrams together with experimental data, it is recommended that the experimental data be written into the POP file so that they can be used to create a file according to the “dataplot” format automatically. This can be done with the GRAPHICS command shown above. The graphical format is described in the Thermo-Cale manual. The default extension of a dataplot file is exp. More elaborate graphics can be edited directly in this file by use of a text editor. The command looks like</p><p>GRAPHICS &lt;dataset&gt; &lt;x-coordinate&gt; &lt;y-coordnate&gt; &lt;GOC&gt;</p><p>Use different datasets for different types of data, i.e., phase diagrams, enthalpies, activities, etc. Each dataset can be selected separately to be overlayed on the calculated data in the post-processor with the APPEND-EXPERIMENTAL-DATA command. The Graphical Operation Code (GOC) can be just a number representing the symbol plotted at the coordinate or a D, meaning draw a line from the previous coordinate to this point (which is useful to indicate tie-lines, for example). See the Thermo-Calc manual for more examples.</p><p>The model setup file</p><p>The second step is to create a “setup” file with the names of the elements and phases, the models for the phases, and all known information such as “lattice stabilities” and Gibbs energies of formation. Most values for the pure elements can be found in the collection amassed by the Scientific Group Thermodata Europe (SGTE) and published by Alan Dinsdale (Dinsdale 1991) or from the SGTE website (http://www.sgte.org). These parameters can also be extracted from the PURE database, which is distributed free with Thermo-Calc. In the Gibbs-energy module there is a command LIST-DATA with option P that can be used to create a template setup file after extracting the data from the PURE database. This template must be edited and new phases and param- eters must be added. The default extension of a setup file is .TCM; this is short for “Thermo-Calc MACRO” file. At the end of the setup file, the work file is created with the PARROT command CREATE-NEW-STORE-FILE. The work file cannot be edited directly and it is hardware-dependent. The default extension of the work file is PAR.</p><p>Models for phases</p><p>The literature with experimental data collected for the POP file usually contain information useful for modeling the phases. If an assessment should be compatible with an existing database, the models for most solution phases often have to be taken from the database. For intermetallic phases it may be important to determine whether the phase has the same structure as a phase in another system.  =========== 7.3.5.2</p><p>7.3 The PARROT module of Thermo-Calc 227</p><p>In the chapter on methodology, chapter 6, the criteria for model selection are discuss&#39; in detail. In summary, one requires</p><p>physical soundness,</p><p>as few parameters as possible that must be optimized, reasonable extrapolations of the model, and consistency with previous assessments.</p><p>Model parameters</p><p>PARROT has 99 variables, also called coefficients or parameters in this book, for opti- mization and can handle up to 1000 experimental measurements, but there are limits to the simultaneous number of variables and experiments. At each optimization the program will list these limits. The variables are called V1 to V99 and they are used when entering functions and parameters to be optimized. For example,</p><p>ENTER-PARAM L(LIQUID,AU,CU;0) 298.15 V1+V2<em>T; 6000 N ENTER-PARAM L(LIQUID,AU,CU;1) 298.15 V3+V4</em>T; 6000 N ENTER-PARAM L(LIQUID,AU,CU;2) 298.15 V5+V6*T; 6000 N</p><p>makes it possible to use three RK parameters, each linearly temperature-dependent, to describe the excess Gibbs energy for the liquid phase in the Au-Cu system. The variables V1 to V6 can be optimized to describe the experimental information. In the setup file one often introduces more variables than will be needed, since it is convenient to have them in sequential order for each phase. In some cases the model requires that several thermodynamic parameters are related, which can conveniently be handled by using the same variables for several parameters. For example, the ordering parameters for a B2 ordered phase can be described by</p><p>ENTER-FUNCTION GAB 298.15 V10+V11*T+GHSERAA+GHSERBB; 6000 N ENTER-PARAMETER G(B2,A:B) 298.15 GAB; 6000 N ENTER-PARAMETER G(B2,B:A) 298.15 GAB; 6000 N</p><p>A stoichiometric compound with measured heat-capacity data may require several variables to describe its temperature dependence, for example</p><p>ENTER-PARAMETER G(MG2SI,MG:SI) 298.15 V20+V21<em>T+V22</em>T<em>LN(T)+ V23</em>T** (-1)+V24<em>T**2+V25</em>T**3; 6000 N</p><p>It is possible to optimize all kinds of parameters in the Gibbs-energy systems that can be described as functions of temperature and pressure. Examples of this are Curie temperatures for magnetic transformations, molar volumes, and thermal expansivities,</p><p>ENTER-PARAMETER TC (SPINEL, FE+2:FE+3:0-2) 298.15 V50+V51*P; 6000 N  =========== 228</p><p>7.3.6</p><p>7.3.7</p><p>73.71</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>File names and relations</p><p>Since all files have different extensions, it is possible to use the same name for all files for an assessment. Thus one may have aucu.POP, aucu.TCM, aucu.exp, and aucu.PAR. In particular, the work file (PAR) may exist in several copies during the assessment; but it is advisable to update the text files POP, TCM, and exp to reflect all changes made interactively in the PAR file.</p><p>The text files, ie., the POP file, the TCM files, and the exp file, are important documentation of the assessment. At the end these should be updated in such a way that it is possible to run the setup file, compile the experiments, and optimize to get the final result directly. This requires that the final weightings be entered into the POP file and the final set of variables used as initial values. With such a set of files, it is easier to reassess</p><p>the system using new experimental data or new models.</p><p>Some care must also be taken with the work (PAR) file. This always contains the last optimized set of variables and the weightings of the selected experimental data. The work file contains a workspace for POLY and for GES. When a diagram is calculated from the current work file, a POLY file is created. This POLY file will have a copy of the current set of variables. If some further optimization is done and the user then by accident tries to READ the old POLY file, he may destroy the new set of variables and overwrite them with the old set. Thus one must never READ a POLY or GES file while running PARROT, but one may, of course, SAVE new POLY or GES files, for example when calculating diagrams from the current set of variables.</p><p>Interactive running of PARROT</p><p>With the three files POP, setup, and dataplot, the user can start running PARROT interactively. This can be divided into some initial separate steps. Usually these steps have to be repeated cyclically, modifying weightings, modifying models, adding new information, etc. It is actually difficult to decide when an assessment is finished. Quite often the deadline for the publication sets the limit for the work.</p><p>The commands on the setup file are executed by the MACRO command. There is usually a number of error messages and the setup file must be corrected and re-run until there are no errors. In the PARROT module one can list interactively the description of the phases, the parameters’ expressions, and the values of the optimizing variables. After a successful run of the setup file, this should be done to check that all models and parameters have been entered correctly.</p><p>Compilation of experiments</p><p>The next step is to “compile” the experimental data file. The command to do this is COMPILE. This compilation will usually also result in a number of error messages due to syntax errors. The compilation normally stops when it detects an error and gives an understandable message. These must be corrected and the file compiled again. It is convenient to use several windows for this, one for editing and one for compiling.  =========== 7.3.7.2</p><p>7.3.7.3</p><p>7.3.74</p><p>7.3 The PARROT module of Thermo-Calc 229</p><p>Sometimes an error message is less understandable and the error may have occurred some lines before the program actually discovers it. Consultation with an expert is usually the best way to correct these problems quickly, since it can be difficult to find the right place to look in the manual. Since the setup file and the POP file are text files, they can easily be E-mailed to experts anywhere in the world.</p><p>Global equilibrium calculations</p><p>The global equilibrium calculation is a new feature in Thermo-Calc version R. By default it is turned off in PARROT and, when using POLY from PARROT, one must explicitly turn it on if one wants to use it. Be very careful doing that, since the reason it is turned off is that global equilibrium calculations may automatically create new composition sets and that will destroy the experimental equilibria in the PAR file.</p><p>Setting alternate mode</p><p>When the experimental data file has been compiled correctly, the first really big problem arises. This is that one must try to calculate the experimental information from the models of the phases. Initially all model parameters are zero and in many cases it might not be possible to calculate a measured value from the model unless the parameters have some reasonable values. In PARROT the alternate mode makes it possible to calculate most of the experimental equilibria even with zero values of the variables. The command SET-ALTERNATE-MODE ON means that experimental equilibria involving two or more phases are calculated with an approximate technique described in section 7.3.9 below. Some extra information may be needed in the alternate mode, as described in section 7.3.9.2. The user may exclude some of the experimental information to be used by setting weights in the EDIT module.</p><p>The OPTIMIZE command in PARROT is then used with the alternate mode until it has converged. Several OPTIMIZE commands are usually needed and the user may have to change the selection of experimental data. This is again done in the EDIT module. The result of an optimization is obtained in a form readable by a human with the command LIST-RESULT. The workfile is continuously updated and always contains the last set of optimized variables and calculated results. Sometimes the user may want to save a copy of the current workfile when trying various selections of experimental data or models. This is done by making a copy of the workfile and giving the copy another name.</p><p>Plotting intermediate results</p><p>Reading the output from LIST-RESULT is usually not enough to understand how good (or bad) a fit one has obtained. Since PARROT is part of Thermo-Cale, it is possible to use POLY directly to calculate the phase diagram and other diagrams with thermodynamic properties and plot them together with the experimental data from the dataplot file. It is important to have MACRO files with the command sequences for such calculations because this should be done frequently. Calculating and plotting the phase diagram may  =========== 230</p><p>7.3.75</p><p>7.3.7.6</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>give many surprising results when the variables to be optimized are far from their final values! Also the fit to activities, chemical potentials, and enthalpy data can be checked with MACRO files by comparing calculated values with the data on the EXP files.</p><p>Selection of experimental data</p><p>Initially it can be difficult to know which experimental data are good and which are problematic; see section 6.1.2 for advice. It is also important to determine a reasonable number of variables to be optimized; see section 6.3.</p><p>Optimization with the alternate mode using all data may give a set of initial values for the variables that reproduces the main features of the system. If not, one may have to exclude data and maybe phases; see section 7.3.10 for some hints.</p><p>When a first set of variables reproducing the main features of the system has been obtained using the ALTERNATE mode, the user should SET-ALTERNATE OFF and thenceforth calculate all equilibria using the normal mode. After turning off ALTERNATE and entering the EDIT module, calculate all experiments with the COMPUTE-ALL command. Several experimental equilibria may still fail to converge and the user may have to provide initial values manually or even remove some equilibria (by setting the weighting to zero). At a later stage in the optimization, when the optimizing variables are closer to their final values, the user may be able to restore and calculate all experimental equilibria.</p><p>When the selected set of equilibria can be calculated in the EDIT module, the user should calculate all experiments once again in the PARROT module using the OPTIMIZE command with only 0 iterations. The output from LIST-RESULT should be examined carefully.</p><p>In this output the experimental information that is badly fitted will be marked with an asterisk “*” in the rightmost column. It is not a problem that many experimental data are badly fitted at this stage, but one should be careful with errors that the optimizer may not be able to solve by itself. A typical case of such a problem is when a phase undergoes congruent melting and there is experimental information on both sides of the congruent transformation. If the composition of the phase is the experimental information, it may happen that the calculated equilibrium is on the “wrong” side of the congruent point and thus gives a large error. The user must correct such problems manually in the EDIT module. A similar error may occur for miscibility gaps when the experi- mental information is from one side and the calculation gives the composition of the other side.</p><p>The listing of results</p><p>The LIST-RESULT command gives a list of the current set of optimizing variables and their values and the fit to each selected experimental point. This may look like Table 7.3.</p><p>In the first section the variables are listed. The first column is the variable symbol as used in the model parameters; one may use variables V1 to V99. The second column is the current optimized value and the third column is the initial value of the variable.

The scaling factor is usually the same as the initial value and it is needed because the variables can be very different in magnitude and, by dividing the values by the scaling factor, the variables’ values will, at least initially, all be set to unity. The final column is the relative standard deviation (RSD), which is an indication of the significance of the variable for the assessment. If the RSD is larger than 0.5, it may be possible to set this variable to zero and still have about the same reduced sum of squares (the last line of the second section in Table 7.3). It is also important to know the number of significant digits in the RSD; see section 7.4.4. Some of the variables have been kept constant during the last optimization.</p><p>After the list of variables, there follows some general information, the number of variables last optimized, that all variables not listed are zero, and how much the sum of squares was changed by the last optimization. The number of degrees of freedom here means the number of experimental points minus the number of optimizing variables. The reduced sum of squares is the sum of squares from the line above divided by the number of degrees of freedom. If this is less than unity, it means that, on average, all experimental data have been fitted to within their estimated uncertainties.</p><p> =========== 232</p><p>73.7.7</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>Calculated 5</p><p>6-4 2 0 2 10° Experimental</p><p>Figure 7.3 Calculated versus experimental values for all experiments from a LIST-RESULT command. If all points are on the diagonal, one has a perfect fit. Since the experimental values have a very wide range, one may have to magnify parts in order to see details. This kind of graph gives a clear indication of whether some experimental datasets are inconsistent with each other.</p><p>Finally, there follows one line for each selected experimental point. Only a few are listed. The first column in this list is the number assigned to the experiment with the CREATE command. Then comes the experimental quantity and the measured value, like MUR(MG) = —6368. The exact meaning of the experimental value is not self-evident from the listing; one must use the EDIT module in order to see all the conditions. The third column shows the calculated values for the current set of variables, the fourth column shows the estimated uncertainties, divided by the weightings assigned, and the fifth column presents the differences between the calculated and experimental values. The final column gives the quotient relating the fifth column and the fourth column; if this is less than unity, it means that one has fitted the experimental value to within the estimated uncertainty. It is the sum of the values in this column squared that is minimized.</p><p>It is sometimes useful to plot the experimental data versus the calculated data and there is a graphical option of the LIST-RESULT command that achieves this. Such an output is shown in Fig. 7.3.</p><p>Critical sets of experimental data and of parameters</p><p>Following the advice in section 6.1.2, a weighting for each experiment that specifies its importance relative to all the other experiments must be determined. The following points should be taken into account when determining this set.</p><p>The reliability of the experimental technique.</p><p>The agreement between independent measurements of the same quantity.</p><p>The agreement between data obtained with different experimental methods.</p><p>One should use only experimentally determined properties, not quantities that have been converted.  =========== 73.7.8</p><p>7.3 The PARROT module of Thermo-Calc 233</p><p>One should be careful about the estimated accuracy of the experiments.</p><p>One must correct systematic errors (in the temperature scale, for example).</p><p>One should bring experience from previous sments to bear.</p><p>One should make use of “negative” information, for example that a phase should not be stable within a certain composition or temperature region.</p><p>When a sensible weighting of the experimental data has been found, this is called the “critical set.”</p><p>The assessor may at any time change the set of model parameters to be optimized. On using more adjustable variables, the sum of errors usually decreases, but at the same time the variables become less well determined. A measure of the significance of the variable is given by the column RSD, which is listed for each variable optimized. The RSD is important only at the end of an assessment. The meaning of the RSD is that the variable can be changed by plus or minus this factor without changing the reduced sum of error by more than one unit. A large RSD thus means that the variable is badly determined. The RSD for all variables should be less than 0.5 in an acceptable assessment.</p><p>The value of the RSD is significant only when the user has run the optimization after a RESCALE and it has converged almost immediately, when the “scaling factor” is the same as the “value.” If there are variables with RSDs larger than unity, it means that too many variables have been used. It is not necessarily the variable with the largest RSD that should be removed, although that is quite likely.</p><p>The value of the RSD depends also on the weighting of the experiments. It may be possible to reduce the RSD by changing the weightings.</p><p>If one has one or more variables with RSDs larger than unity, one should try to remove one or more optimizing variables by setting them to zero, or to some value that can be determined from other information, for example by semi-empirical estimation methods.</p><p>Optimize and continue to optimize</p><p>Using the critical set of experiments, which may be modified now and again, and trying various numbers of model parameters to be optimized, the user must use his skills to get the best possible result. The smaller the sum of errors the better and, by giving the command OPTIMIZE, CONTINUE, RESCALE, and OPTIMIZE again, the user may finally reach a point at which PARROT states that it cannot improve the set of optimizing variables. This should not be trusted, however, so a few more OPTIMIZE runs should be done. If PARROT converges with the same number of iterations as there are variables to optimize, one has to accept this set.</p><p>A problem with using OPTIMIZE several times to make the optimization converge is that sometimes a variable may suddenly start to change by several orders of mag- nitude. This behavior may lead to impossible values of variables and requires careful reconsideration of the weighting of the critical set of experimental data and of the model parameters that are being optimized. There is a reasonable range to which the values of variables should be restricted. Finding interaction parameters of the order of 107 for the  =========== 234</p><p>73.7.9</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>temperature-independent part and 10? for the temperature dependence is a clear indication of a bad weighting of the experimental data or the use of too many parameters.</p><p>If the user is still not satisfied with the overall fit, he has to change the weights or add more information to force the optimization in the right direction. The success of such manipulations depends on the skill of the assessor.</p><p>Wrong phases at wrong places</p><p>During the optimization it may happen that a phase appears at the wrong temperature or composition in the phase diagram. Typically a phase may be stable only on one side of the diagram, but on calculating the diagram using the optimized variables, it may appear also on the other side. This can be handled most easily by the DGM state variable.</p><p>For example, if fec becomes stable at high Mg content in an assessment of the Ag—-Mg system, one may modify an experimental equilibrium on the high-Mg side by adding as experimental data the criterion that the driving force for fec should be negative. For example,</p><p>CREATE-NEW-EQUILIBRIUM 900 1 CHANGE-STATUS PHASE HCP LIQ=FIX 1 SET-COND P=1E5 X(LIQ,AG)=0.12 EXPERIMENT T=900:10</p><p>LABEL AHL</p><p>can be modified by adding two lines as below:</p><p>CREATE-NEW-EQUILIBRIUM 900 1 CHANGE-STATUS PHASE HCP LIQ=FIX 1 CHANGE-STATUS PHASE FCC=DORMANT SET-COND P=1E5 X(LIQ,AG)=0.12 EXPERIMENT T=900:10</p><p>EXPERIMENT DGM(FCC)&lt;-.001:.001 LABEL AHL</p><p>The DGM experiment will give a contribution to the sum of errors if fee is stable at this equilibrium and this will make the optimizer try to decrease the stability of fcc. One should give a small negative number rather than zero, since fcc is stable also when the driving force is zero. Thus fcc is set as dormant and will not affect the calculated equilibrium, but the driving force for forming fcc will be calculated.</p><p>This type of error is common when phases are modeled for the whole composition range but may be stable only on one side. If many RK coefficients, see section 5.6.2.1, are used to describe the phase, then these may have unexpected and unwanted effects on the other side.</p><p>The DGM experiment makes use of the feature in PARROT that one may specify a limit rather than a fixed value as experimental data, as described in section 7.3.3.6.</p><p>One may use a similar method if a phase is not stable over the whole temperature range within which it should exist. For example, when there are several intermediate  =========== 7.3.7.10</p><p>7.3 The PARROT module of Thermo-Calc 235</p><p>phases in a system it may be difficult to make stable those that should be stable at room temperature. One may then use fictitious experimental data with just the DGM experiment to enforce the correct set of stable phases at room temperature. In many cases there are no experimental data for the enthalpy of formation of an intermediate phase, so one should be careful not to trust blindly hand-drawn extrapolations of stability lines.</p><p>Unwanted miscibility gaps</p><p>During an optimization it is possible that the model parameters for some phases create unwanted miscibility gaps in the phase. A typical example is that the liquid sometimes has a miscibility gap at high temperatures. It is possible to keep control of this by adding some “experimental” data that should be outside the spinodal, see section 2.1.10, at a certain temperature and composition like in this example:</p><p>CREATE-NEW-EQUILIBRIUM 910 1 CHANGE-STATUS PHASE LIQ=FIX 1 SET-COND T=4000 P=1E5 X(LIQ,AG)=0.4 EXPERIMENT QF (LIQUID)&gt;1:.001</p><p>LABEL AQL</p><p>This equilibrium will calculate the single liquid at 4000 K and X(AG) = 0.4 and, if the liquid is inside the spinodal, the value of QF(LIQUID) will be negative. Here it is required that QF(LIQUID) be larger than unity in order to be on the safe side. QF is a “state variable” in PARROT and POLY that has the value of the smallest eigenvalue of the determinant of all second derivatives of the Gibbs energy with respect to all constituents.</p><p>One should be careful with added “experiments” like DGM and QF since they may restrict the optimization severely. Toward the end of the optimization, when one should be close to having found a global minimum, one should try to remove them.</p><p>Phases with order—disorder transitions</p><p>A model for a phase that can be ordered like the B2 and L1, phase will have several sublattices with the same set of constituents; see section 5.8.4. For an experimental equilibrium involving an ordered phase, the disordered state may become more stable than the ordered any time during the optimization. To have control of the state of order in a phase, one can add a function that calculates the difference between the site fractions and returns an error if the state of order is wrong. For example, the congruent transformation of Lly to Al in the Au—Cu system can be written</p><p>ENTER FUNCTION DL10=¥ (FCC#3, CU) -Y¥(FCC#3 ,CU#3) ; ENTER FUNCTION DHTR=HMR (FCC) -HMR(FCC#3) ; CREATE 320 1</p><p>CHANGE-STATUS PHASE FCC FCC#3=FIX 1 SET-CONDITION P=1 X(FCC,CU)-X(FCC#3,CU)=0 EXPERIMENT T=683:2  =========== 236</p><p>7.3.7.12</p><p>7.3.8</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>EXPERIMENT DHTR=4000:1000 EXPERIMENT X(CU)=.5:.01 EXPERIMENT DL10&gt;0.1:0.001</p><p>The model for the ordered (and disordered) FCC phase is (Au, Cu)o.25(Au, Cu)o.25(Au, Cu)ors(Au, Cu)oas</p><p>and the L1, ordering (indicated as FCC#3) has a high site fraction of Au on two sublattices and a high site fraction of Cu on the other two. The disordered phase (indicated as FCC) has all site fractions equal in all sublattices. The congruent transformation is specified by giving as a condition the stipulation that the two phases should have the same composition. As experimental data the temperature, enthalpy of transformation (FUNCTION DHTR), and overall composition are used. Additionally, a function called DL10 is used to calculate the difference between the site fractions of Cu on the first and third sublattices. If these are equal, the phase is disordered, which is wrong, and the value will be zero, which will give a large error in the EXPERIMENT DL10&gt;0.1:0.001.</p><p>One should not use the “partition model,” see section 5.8.4.2, for ordering when assess- ing a phase with an order—disorder transformation unless one has extensive information both on the ordered and on the disordered phase throughout the whole composition range, as in the Au-Cu system, for example. In other cases the partitioning will create problems because there is an ambiguity regarding how much enthalpy should be in the disordered state and how much in the ordered. The split can be made without any ambiguity when the assessment is added to a database.</p><p>Some more hints</p><p>Many problems and errors may occur and it is not possible to give simple explanations of how to handle them. The main recommendation is that one should exclude all experimental data that give strange results but make sure that all important invariant equilibria are reasonably calculated. If some invariant equilibria cannot be calculated, it may be better to exclude the phases that are involved in these, if they are intermediate phases, and just optimize the liquid and the most important solution phases in a first step with a full equilibrium calculation. When reasonable results have been obtained with the most important phases, the intermediate phases may be put back and optimized, keeping the model parameters for the already-optimized liquid and solid phases fixed. Consult section 7.3.10 for more hints, since it is impossible to give any more general advice at this stage.</p><p>Changes made interactively that require recompilation</p><p>It is possible to change almost everything from the initial setup and POP file interactively. For example, one may add more variables to be optimized, and modify, or add more, experimental information, but there are some changes that will destroy the data structure and thus require that the experimental data file be recompiled. An example of such a change is adding more composition sets to a phase. This actually changes the number of  =========== 7.3.9</p><p>7.3.9.1</p><p>7.3 The PARROT module of Thermo-Calc 237</p><p>phases, which will destroy the links between the experimental data and the thermodynamic models. Thus the POP file must be recompiled and it is then important that the POP file reflect the changes made interactively in the EDIT-EXPERIMENT module.</p><p>One practical problem with recompiling the POP file may also be that the experi- mental equilibria will be calculated with the default initial values of all compositions. In some systems the equilibria require manual input of initial values and recompilation of the POP file may then require careful massaging of the experimental equilibria to make them converge again. To simplify the recompilation, it is recommended that one use the command AMEND-PHASE in the GES module to set the major constituents for the phases, since these are used as the default initial values (see the GES user’s guide for details). It is possible to provide initial values of the constitutions of the phases in the POP file. It is possible to make a new POP file from the current PAR file by giving the command MAKE-POP-FILE in the EDIT module. However, this file does not contain the initial tables, etc.</p><p>The alternate mode</p><p>The information that PARROT uses to optimize the thermodynamic model parameters represents measurements at equilibrium in the system. The measurements can be made in a single-phase region, for example activities or enthalpies, in two-phase regions, for example solubilities or transformation temperatures, or with more than two phases involved. At each equilibrium, at least one quantity must have been measured in addition to those necessary to determine the equilibrium state. For a binary system in a single-phase region, one may have measured the temperaure, pressure, composition, and chemical potential. Three of these quantities are necessary in order to specify the equilibrium state and the fourth can be used as experimental information to model the phase. In a two-phase region at given temperature and pressure, one may have determined the stable phases and the composition of one or both phases. The temperature, pressure, and set of phases are sufficient to determine the equilibrium and the compositions can then be used as experimental data.</p><p>Common-tangent construction</p><p>It is easy to understand that it may be difficult to calculate an equilibrium between two or more phases when the model parameters for the phases are badly determined. The equilibrium calculation requires that one can find a “common tangent,” i.e., that the chemical potentials for all components are the same in all phases. Such a common tangent might not exist or may be at a completely wrong composition or temperature for the initial set of model parameters; see section 7.1.1.</p><p>Instead of requiring that an equilibrium should be calculated between two or more phases, PARROT supports an “alternate” technique to use such experimental information. The alternate technique calculates the thermodynamic properties for each phase sepa- rately and the program uses as “experimental information” the difference in chemical potential for the components in each phase. The model parameters are then adjusted to  =========== 238</p><p>7.3.9.2</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>make the chemical potentials of all components the same. This is not a new technique; it was possible to describe equilibria in this way in PARROT earlier, but it was cum- bersome and difficult. In the BINGSS software the options IVERS=1 or IVERS=3 have been available from the beginning, and these make use of the same technique as the alternate mode to calculate chemical potentials for each phase separately rather than the full equilibrium.</p><p>Preparation of the POP file for the alternate mode</p><p>Alternate calculation of the experimental equilibria with two or more stable phases is set by the SET-ALTERNATE-MODE Y command in the PARROT module. The POP file will usually require additional information to handle this option because there must be enough information to calculate each phase separately. For example, if both compositions of a binary tie-line have been measured, this may be given in the POP file as</p><p>CREATE 1 1</p><p>CH-ST PH FCC BCC=FIX 1</p><p>SET-COND P=1E5 T=1000</p><p>EXPERIMENT X(BCC,B)=.2:.01 X(FCC,B)=</p><p>01</p><p>The equilibrium above can be calculated with the alternate mode without any mod- ification. PARROT will use the values given as EXPERIMENT as conditions when calculating the thermodynamic properties of each phase, but, if just one side of the tie-line has been measured, one must provide an estimate of the composition of the other phase. This can be added by the SET-ALTERNATE-CONDITION command in the POP file. A command SET-ALT-COND is ignored unless the alternate mode is set. The same example as above would then be</p><p>CREATE 11</p><p>CH-ST PH FCC BCC=FIX 1 SET-COND P=1E5 T=1000 EXPERIMENT X(BCC,B)=.2:.01 SET-ALT-COND X(FCC,B)=.3</p><p>When PARROT calculates the thermodynamic properties of the bec phase, it will use the composition provided as EXPERIMENT.

In later stages of the optimization, it can be interesting to calculate the metastable phase diagram with just these phases in order to check that the metastable solubility lines do not have any strange kinks or turns.</p><ol><li>Phases with miscibility gaps, stable or metastable, are often problematic; see</li></ol><p>section 6.2.7. Try to keep control of the gap by use of some real or estimated experimental information. Unfortunately, PARROT cannot calculate the top of a  =========== 240</p><p>7.3.11</p><p>74</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>miscibility gap as a single experimental equilibrium. Use the stability function QF to have control of any unwanted (or wanted) miscibility gaps.</p><ol><li>Phases with order—disorder transformations are also problematic. They quite often</li></ol><p>require manual input of initial values and sometimes the ordered state may disappear during the optimization. It may help to add an experimental criterion that controls the state of order; see section 7.3.7.11.</p><ol><li>The alternate mode, section 7.3.9, is a new feature in PARROT, so no-one has</li></ol><p>much experience with it. It should be used only to find an initial set of values for the adjustable variables that can be used to make it possible to calculate the experimental equilibria in the normal mode. It may also be used to get an initial set of variables for an intermediate phase that was initially excluded, keeping the values of already-fitted variables fixed.</p><ol><li>When the liquid and some solution phases have been fitted reasonably well, the</li></ol><p>optimizing variables describing these phases can be set fixed and the variables for the intermediary phases optimized.</p><ol><li>Check continually that the optimized variables fall within reasonable ranges. When</li></ol><p>a variable starts to change by several orders of magnitude in the later stages of an optimization, one must reconsider the experimental weightings or check whether too many variables are being used.</p><ol><li>Phases that appear in wrong places can be handled with the DGM experiment; see</li></ol><p>section 7.3.7.9.</p><ol><li>A final optimization with all variables and all selected experimental information,</li></ol><p>with the appropriate weightings, should be done. This file should be saved as documentation of the assessment.</p><p>Time taken for stages of an assessment using PARROT</p><p>A rough and maybe very personal estimate of the time spent on various stages of an assessment is</p><p>25% on collecting experimental data and creating, correcting, and updating the POP, setup, and dataplot files;</p><p>25% on “optimizing the weights” to find the correct balance among various types of experimental information and selecting a critical set of experimental information;</p><p>25% on optimizing the adjustable variables; and</p><p>25% on writing the report.</p><p>Quite often one has to go back and reoptimize when one finds that a selection or decision made during the optimization cannot be explained or defended in the report.</p><p>Final remarks</p><p>Most of the information here can also be found in chapter 6, but repetition is one way</p><p>of learning important facts. It is rarely the case that the assessor finishes an assessment</p><p> =========== 7.4.1</p><p>74.2</p><p>7.4.3</p><p>7.4 Final remarks 241</p><p>with the feeling that it cannot be improved. It is usually money or time that determines when the assessment is finished.</p><p>Conflicting data</p><p>In some cases one may find measurements of the same quantity that are widely different. All such data should be entered into the experimental data file unless there are obvious reasons (impurity of samples, for example) why some set can be rejected. However, during the optimization one should not include two conflicting sets at the same time but rather use only one at a time together with the rest of the data. This follows from a simple rule formulated by Bo Jansson, the creator of PARROT: if you have two con- flicting datasets then either one or the other may be correct or both may be wrong. A fitted curve in between is most certainly wrong. It is to be hoped that the optimiza- tion can clarify which dataset is most in agreement with the other information on the system.</p><p>There are also cases in which conflicting data cannot be detected directly. For example, it might not be possible to reconcile activity data with solubility data from the phase diagram. This is indicated by large errors in the fit when both datasets are included. Thus it may be necessary to try to optimize with some datasets excluded in order to find these inconsistencies. For more discussion on this, see section 6.4.2.</p><p>The number of adjustable coefficients</p><p>Usually an assessment is considered better the fewer adjustable coefficients are needed to get the same fit, although it does not matter much whether 12 or 13 coefficients were needed. However, if one can get almost the same fit with 8 instead of 12 coefficients, then the assessment with 8 can be considered a superior fit. More of this topic is discussed in section 6.3. However, in an assessment one may put different weightings on different kinds of information and it is very difficult to compare assessments.</p><p>It is important to use a small number of coefficients also for the reason that the assessment will be used for extrapolations to higher-order systems. From experience it has been found that the fewer coefficients are used for binary systems the fewer problems occur with higher-order systems.</p><p>Analysis of results</p><p>In section 6.6 the points to check are listed, including the analysis of the final result, which should include the following.</p><p>A satisfactory description of the critical set of experiments.</p><p>A satisfactory description of data not included in the critical set.</p><p>A reasonable set of values of the adjustable coefficents.</p><p>Reasonable extrapolations of the thermodynamic properties, also to higher-order</p><p>systems. e A comparison with the results obtained using other critical sets or models.  =========== 242</p><p>744</p><p>745</p><p>Optimization tools</p><p>Rounding off of coefficients</p><p>At the end of the optimization all optimized coefficients have several digits that must be truncated. There is a simple method by which to round them off when dealing with metallic systems, by keeping as many digits as will give less than 1 J mol~&#39; difference at 1000 K. For aqueous systems or systems assessed for very different temperature ranges, one may have to use other criteria. Rounding off that gives differences larger than 1Jmol! may give detectable changes in the phase diagram or for other experimental data.</p><p>If the coefficients have many digits, this can give an impression of high accuracy, which fact has led to another philosophy for rounding off. In PARROT one starts this rounding off by considering the optimized variable with the highest RSD, which is usually larger than 0.1. This means that this variable has only one significant digit. One may thus round it off to just one digit and trailing zeros. However, this will change the sum of errors and the remaining variables must be reoptimized with the rounded variable kept fixed. One should reach almost the same reduced sum of errors with the remaining variables; otherwise the variable set fixed was not the best one to round off.</p><p>When rounding off the first variable has been successful, one may continue to round off the new variable with the largest RSD in the remaining set by setting it fixed and reoptimizing the rest. The RSD for the remaining variables will decrease for each variable set fixed and, if 0.1 &gt; RSD &gt; 0.01, the variable has two significant digits and so on. This can continue until there is just one variable left. The final sum of errors should not deviate significantly from the initial one obtained when all variables were optimized. The rounded variables are easier to handle than those just rounded with many non-zero digits.</p><p>The SGTE raw data format for experimental data</p><p>The SGTE has decided on a format for storing experimental data for use in an assessment program. All software that is used for such a purpose should be able to read and write a file in this format. It is important that all decisions made by the assessor on the quality of the data and the final selection are reflected in this file, also those made interactively. In this way it is possible to reproduce the assessment at a later time, possibly together with new experimental data or to test a new thermodynamic model or new software. This format is available on the website for this book.</p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="catppuccin-latte">catppuccin-latte</option><option value="catppuccin-frappe">catppuccin-frappe</option><option value="catppuccin-macchiato">catppuccin-macchiato</option><option value="catppuccin-mocha">catppuccin-mocha</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.8.0 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Saturday 14 December 2024 13:26">Saturday 14 December 2024</span>.
