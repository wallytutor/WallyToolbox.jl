The integral Gibbs energy will be used as the modeled thermodynamic property. The reason to model the Gibbs energy rather than any other thermodynamic function is that most experiments are done at constant temperature and pressure. From the Gibbs energy all other important quantities can be obtained according to Eqs. (2.12). Using the Gibbs energy means that the modeling is limited to a “mean-field” approximation. Thermodynamic calculations using “Monte Carlo” methods or “molecular dynamics” are outside the scope of this presentation, but these techniques can provide important information about the type of mean-field model to be selected.</p><p>A phase may sometimes have a particular physical or chemical feature that requires a special model in order for it to be described accurately. It is not uncommon that the mathematical expression for such a model may be identical to the expression derived to describe another physical feature. That simply means that the mathematical expression is more general than the physical model. Whenever such a generalized expression can be obtained, it will be called a formalism. A general formalism should be able to handle cases when various constituents added to a phase behave differently, for example some may dissolve interstitially or cause chemical ordering. Most of the models used in this book are special cases of the compound-energy formalism (CEF). The physical meanings of the CEF parameters in various models differ and this will be discussed in detail.</p><p>The models for the phases in a thermodynamic system can be selected independently, except for the case when two phases are members of a structure family. Phases with chemical ordering form structure families and they may be modeled with the same Gibbs energy function, but usually only rather simple structural relations can be described with a single Gibbs energy function, for example A2/B2 and A1/L1,.</p><p>The Gibbs energy for a phase can be attributed to two main factors, the bonding between the constituents and their configuration. The configurational part always enhances the mixing of unlike atoms. The bond energy between two unlike atoms may be either more negative than the bond energy between two equal atoms (creating a tendency for compound formation or ordering) or more positive (creating a tendency for there to be a miscibility gap).</p><p>The selection of the model for a phase must be based on the physical and chemical properties of the phase, for example crystallography, type of bonding, order—disorder</p><p>79  =========== 80</p><p>5.1</p><p>Models for the Gibbs energy</p><p>transitions, and magnetic properties. Most of the models for crystalline phases described here will take into account the crystal structure of the phases by dividing it into sublattices characterized by different crystallographic symmetries and numbers of nearest neighbors. Sometimes a sublattice has just a single constituent, but usually several constituents can enter a sublattice. By selecting one constituent in each sublattice, one has a stoichiometric compound with fixed composition. The Gibbs energy of formation of that compound contains the most important part of the bond energies. In the simplest case the compound can be a pure element if the phase has a single set of sites and the elements as constituents. Any solution phase has at least two such compounds and they are then called the “end members” of the solution phase. The end members define the limit of solubility, but the model may have end members with a composition inside the composition range of the phase. Examples of this are a gas phase with molecules such that each molecule is an end member and an ordered phase in which some end members represent the possible ordered states. See also section 5.2.3.</p><p>In order to describe the measured phase equilibria and the thermodynamic properties of a system, it is necessary to adjust a number of parameters in the Gibbs-energy model of the phases. The aim of this book is to teach the reader how to make a good choice of models and obtain the best possible set of model parameters that describe the experimen- tal information and are useful for extrapolations to multicomponent systems. The term parameter will be used for a quantity that is part of a model, like excess parameter. Some parameters can be a function of temperature, pressure, or even composition, and thus can be split into several other parameters. Each parameter may consist of several coefficients and a coefficient is always just a single numerical value. In the PARROT software, see section 7.3, the term variable is used with the same meaning as coefficient.</p><p>The selection of models described here has been based on those currently implemented in either of the two software packages that are described in more detail in this book. New models are continuously being developed and added to the software, so a future user can expect to have an even larger choice of models than that described here.</p><p>The general form of the Gibbs-energy model</p><p>The total Gibbs energy of a phase @ is expressed as</p><p>Gh agi pomsg? — rims’ 4 EG (5.1)</p><p>The superscript @ denoting the phase will normally be omitted in the rest of this chapter since all expressions are valid for a particular phase. The pre-superscript “srf” stands for “surface of reference” and represents the Gibbs energy of an unreacted mixture of the constituents of the phase. Not included in this is the quantity &quot;™*G,, which represents the contribution to the Gibbs energy due to a physical model such as magnetic transitions, as described in section 5.4. These models may be composition-dependent through particular physical quantities like the Curie temperature and the Bohr magneton number.</p><p>The pre-superscript “cnf” stands for the configurational entropy of the phase and is based on the number of possible arrangements of the constituents in the phase given</p><p> =========== 5.2</p><p>5.2.1</p><p>5.2 Phases with fixed composition 81</p><p>by Eq. (2.9). This can easily be extended to include random arrangements on several sublattices. More elaborate methods to predict the entropy of configuration, like the cluster-variation method (CVM), can be derived for specific crystalline structures and will be discussed in section 5.7.2.2.</p><p>The term with pre-superscript “E” stands for the excess Gibbs energy and describes the remaining part of the real Gibbs energy of the phase when the first three terms have been subtracted from the real Gibbs energy. This partitioning means that there is no attempt to model the physical origins of the Gibbs energy, except those included in ™&quot;SG,,. The terms “&#39;G,,, and G,, will thus include configurational as well as vibrational, electronic, and other contributions.</p><p>In this chapter a number of models for the various parts will be described. The temper- ature and pressure dependences of the Gibbs energy for a phase with fixed composition will be described first. Then the magnetic model will be described as an example of a physical property that is modeled separately. The reason for a separate description of this contribution to the Gibbs energy is that the magnetic properties of the phase depend on the critical temperature for magnetic ordering and the Bohr magneton number, and the composition dependences of these quantities must be described separately. The descrip- tion of the models for composition dependence will start with the simplest cases and gradually introduce more complex features of real phases.</p><p>Phases with fixed composition</p><p>A phase with fixed composition can be a pure element, a stoichiometric compound, or a solution phase whose composition is kept constant externally. The Gibbs energy of such a phase can depend on temperature and pressure only. An important class of such phases is constituted by the “end members” of solutions, a term introduced at the beginning of this chapter.</p><p>Temperature dependence</p><p>Except for the ferromagnetic transition, described in section 5.4.2, the temperature depen- dence of the molar Gibbs energy, G,,, of a stable end member of a phase 6 is often described by a power series in temperature like</p><p>GE =D dH = ay ta,Tt+a,Tin(T)+a,0? +a,T&#39;+aP+-, T,&lt;T&lt;T, (5.2)</p><p>where b; is the stoichiometric factor of element i in @ and &gt;; b;HS®® represents the sum of the enthalpies of the elements in their reference states, usually the stable state at 298.15 K and 1 bar, denoted SER. This term is needed because there is no absolute value of the enthalpy of a system and one must select some reference state. Such a power series can be valid for a limited temperature region only, here delimited by 7, and 7.  =========== 82 Models for the Gibbs energy</p><p>The coefficients in Eq. (5.2) expressing the temperature dependence of the end-member parameter cannot be related directly to any other thermodynamic quantity, but, using the relations in Eqs. (2.12), one obtains.</p><p>@ SER _ 2 1 3 i = a — aT —as a 5 3 Hi -S bx: dy — aT —a3T* +2a,T! —2asT*+– (5.3) 8 = —a,—a,(1+In(T)) —2a,7 +a,T? —3asT? ++ (5.4) Co = —a) —2a;T —2a,T~ —6asT?- ++ 5.5) ? 2 m</p><p>From the expression for the heat capacity, C,, it can be seen that the coefficient for the T In(7) term in Eq. (5.2) originates from the temperature-independent heat- capacity coefficient. These quantities for pure Cu, from Dinsdale (1991), are plotted in Fig. 5.1.</p><p>The expression above is suitable for expressing the Gibbs energy for a limited temper- ature range and above the Debye temperature. If the coefficients are fitted to experimental data and the expression is then used far outside the known temperature range, or down to OK, severe problems with using this power series will occur. Thus there is an interest in developing and using temperature-dependent models based on the physical properties of the phase, namely lattice vibrations, thermal vacancies etc. At present, however, physical models are rarely used for modeling the heat capacity except for a model for ferromag- netic transitions described below. The lower temperature limit is usually 298.15 K, which is sufficiently low to allow calculations of the equilibrium in most heterogeneous sys- tems that require diffusion in order to reach the equilibrium state. At lower temperatures diffusion is usually not possible and thus there is little practical interest in extending the model to lower temperatures.</p><p>32 . 1 . 50 L . i 314 ae ye o4 L &amp; 2904 L E é 3 28 2 z2 -s04 G L S 274 &gt; 3 2 5 -Ts g 26 4 5 3 25] -100 4 L 24 4 23 T T 1 — 150 T T T A 30 600 9001200 1500 YA 300 600 90012001500 Temperature (K) Temperature (k) (a) (b)</p><p>Figure 5.1.

A method by which to decrease the number of coefficients is to use several temper- ature ranges and different expressions in each. This method is also needed in order to have backward compatibility with the time when thermodynamic data were usually described by giving the heat of formation and entropy at 298.15 K and | bar together with a four-coefficient heat-capacity expression. In such cases there were usually at least two and often up to four or five temperature regions with different coefficients. Note that it is mandatory that the first and second derivatives of the Gibbs energy must be continuous through such a breakpoint, otherwise it would behave like a phase transition.</p><p>Pressure dependence</p><p>The pressure-dependent properties such as volume and thermal expansivity are often ignored in thermodynamic models. For condensed phases they are important for the equilibrium only at very high pressures, but the molar volume can be important in phase transformations and knowledge of it is necessary in order to obtain the volume fraction of a phase. For the gas phase, except close to the critical point or the boiling point, it is sufficient to describe the pressure dependence by one term, RT In(p/p ). For the condensed phases a model suggested by Murnaghan (1944) is useful for limited pressure ranges.</p><p>The Murnaghan pressure model</p><p>In the Murnaghan model one assumes that the bulk modulus can be expressed by a linear pressure dependence. The following expression is used for the compressibility, «, which is the inverse of the bulk modulus:</p><p>_— Kol) OP TE KD</p><p>(5.6) where K,(7) is the compressibility at zero pressure and n is a constant independent of temperature and pressure. Experimentally n is found to be about 4 for many phases. The thermal expansivity can usually be described as a power series in temperature and, in order to have reasonable extrapolations from low temperatures, at which most measurements are made, to high temperatures, one should use an expression of the form</p><p>a@=a)ta,T+a,T? +: (5.7)</p><p>and avoid higher powers than one. This model was used in an assessment of pure iron by Fernandez Guillermet and Gustafson (1984) and Fig. 5.2(a) shows the phase diagram for iron for varying temperatures and pressures. In Fig. 5.2(b) the pressure axis has been changed to the molar volumes.  =========== 84</p><p>5.2.2.2</p><p>Models for the Gibbs energy 2500 2500 liquid liquid 2000 + 2000 4 r l &lt; hee &lt; foc Bee @ fec 2 15004 b ® 15004 r 5 5 &amp; 2 1000 4 F 5 5 e e hep 1000 4 500 | bee L bee hep 500 ° A © 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 A 5 60 6 70 75 80 Pressure (GPa) Molar volume (1077 m3) (a) (b)</p><p>Figure 5.2.

In most high-pressure models the volume is then used as independent variable, but in such a case it is no longer a model for the Gibbs energy.</p><p>A new pressure model</p><p>A new pressure-dependent model was proposed by Lu er al. (2005) because the compo- sition dependences of the parameters in the Murnaghan model, Vj, a, Ko, and n, make it very cumbersome to handle when calculating partial Gibbs energies. This model is based on the empirical relation proposed by Grover et al. (1973):</p><p>Vr. p) = WT) ~«(ryn( 0) 69) K«(T, p)</p><p>where V,(7) and K)(7) are the volume and compressibility at zero pressure and c(T) is</p><p>an adjustable function. This can be integrated to give a surprisingly simple Gibbs-energy</p><p>expression:</p><p>=========== 5.2.3</p><p>5.2 Phases with fixed composition 85</p><p>The expression for the volume as a function of temperature and pressure is more complicated and involves the exponential integral, Ei, defined as</p><p>(5.11)</p><p>(5.12)</p><p>V(T, p) = cere</p><p>(T)</p><p>where Ei! is the inverse of the exponential integral.</p><p>The advantage of this model is that one can include more easily the composition dependences of the parameters and it is thus better suited for modeling solution phases. Another advantage is that the model can be extended to higher pressure ranges than can the Murnaghan model.</p><p>Metastable states, lattice stabilities, and end members</p><p>When a new component can dissolve in a compound, it forms a solution phase and the stability range of the phase can be extended also in temperature. A consequence of this is that the Gibbs energy of the solution phase must have a value at the endpoint representing the compound also at temperatures outside its range of stability. Thus experimental data are not always enough to fit coefficients in the temperature models even for compounds. An example of such extrapolation is shown in Fig. 5.3, where the heat capacity and Gibbs energy of various forms of pure iron (Fernandez Guillermet and Gustafson 1984) have been extrapolated from 298.15 to 2000 K.</p><p>In other cases the Gibbs energies of compounds that are never stable are needed.

With some care the results from total-energy calculations can be used as “experiments” together with real experimental data with the thermodynamic models described here.</p><p>Most elements have only one or two stable crystal structures, but they may have some solubility in many different phases. When the solubility is large, it is necessary to estimate a value of the relative stability of the metastable structure as an “end member” of the phase. These values for pure elements are called “lattice stabilities.” Several estimates of such unary data have been made. Those currently most used are the comprehensive SGTE set published by Dinsdale (1991). The Ringberg meetings (Aldinger et al. 1995, 1997) may lead to a completely new set with improved models. It is important to agree on the values for these metastable states, even if they are very uncertain, because one cannot change the value of the Gibbs energy of formation of a stable or metastable end-member state without reassessing all parts of the thermodynamic database that depend on the previous value. This problem is not so big for structures stable in some range of T and p because their thermodynamic properties can be determined by measurements and thus one can always refer to experimental data, but for metastable states there are estimates that may differ by a factor of ten or more.</p><p>For compounds with no measured heat capacity it is usual to apply the Kopp—Neumann rule (Grimvall, 1999) that the heat capacity of the compound is equal to the stoichiometric average of the heat capacities of the pure elements in their SER. The Gibbs energy will then be</p><p>Gh -YbG* =ay+aT (5.13)</p><p>In comparison with Eq. (5.2), there are only two coefficients that have to be determined from experimental data because the heat capacity will be taken from the descriptions of the pure elements. If there are special reasons, for example the coordination number for a lattice site, one may refer an element to some phase other than the SER. The same equation is also applied to the end members used for modeling solution phases that have a composition within the composition range of the phase.</p><p>The main contribution to the heat capacity of a solution is due to the temperature dependences of the “end members” of solutions. Most other model parameters used to describe the properties of solutions are only linearly temperature-dependent; at most a T In(T) term is used to describe a composition-dependent excess heat capacity, but any higher power of T is discouraged except for the “end members.”</p><p>At the Ringberg meetings a new way to perform the extrapolation above and below the liquidus temperature for the pure elements has been proposed (Agren et al. 1995); in particular, by including the glass transition. This will not be treated further here, since it has not yet been implemented in the software generally used for assessments.</p><p>Extrapolations of the Gibbs energy of the liquid below the melting temperature and of the Gibbs energy for the solid phases above the melting temperature are necessary when one considers solution phases. The SGTE group (Dinsdale 1991) has introduced breakpoints in the Gibbs energy at the melting temperature of the liquid and the stable solid phase. This usually works well for phase-equilibria calculations but sometimes gives  =========== 5.3</p><p>5.3.1</p><p>5.3 Variables for composition dependence 87</p><p>strange results for calculated thermodynamic functions. Several other suggestions have been made for extrapolations, but most of them can be treated with the series expression above.</p><p>Variables for composition dependence</p><p>The Gibbs energy, G, of a phase depends on the amounts of the constituents in the phase. For modeling the composition dependence it is more convenient to use the molar Gibbs energy, G,,, defined in Eq. (2.14) and give the size of the system as the total amount of components, N, which is the sum of moles of all components N;:</p><p>G=N-G, (5.14)</p><p>N=DN (5.15)</p><p>In this chapter “Gibbs energy” will be used to mean “molar Gibbs energy,” except when clearly noted otherwise. The composition variables describing the composition</p><p>dependence of G,, are in the simplest case the mole fractions of the components, x;,, defined as</p><p>(5.16)</p><p>The composition is sometimes expressed in mass fractions (often wrongly called weight fractions) and it is defined as</p><p>w= (5.17) where M, is the mass of component i and M = )°; M;. The mole or mass percent is the respective fraction multiplied by 100.</p><p>For a closed system the amounts of the various components of a system are “external” variables that can be controlled from outside the system. In each phase in the system the components may form many different species or ions and enter as constituents various types of sites in a crystalline phase.</p><p>The “composition” of a phase in a system at equilibrium is the amounts or fractions of all components in the phase. This can be expressed using the mole fractions or the mass fractions defined above.</p><p>Components other than the elements</p><p>The number of components for a system is always equal to the number of elements, but one may prefer to use components other than the elements. For example, in an oxide system (Ca, Mg, O) one may prefer to use (CaO, MgO, O,) as components if the composition is entirely inside the binary system (CaO, MgO). This case will be discussed in more detail in the section on quasibinary systems (section 6.2.4.5).  =========== 88</p><p>Models for the Gibbs energy</p><p>At equilibrium the chemical potential of a component j is related to the chemical potentials of the elements i by the reaction</p><p>By = ditt; (5.18) j</p><p>where bj; is the stoichiometric factor of component i in constituent j and y; is the chemical potential of constituent j.</p><p>An example of the use of this relation is if one wants to know the chemical potential of H,O in a gas with the components H, and O,. The equation above gives</p><p>Mao = Hu, + 0-5Ho, (5.19)</p><p>This can be related to the classical “law of mass action” if one assumes that the gas is ideal, see section 5.5.4, because then one has for each molecule</p><p>Ho, = °Go, +RT In(yo,) My, = °Gu, +RT In(yy,) (5.20) Huo = °Gu,o + RT In(yy,0)</p><p>where y; is the equilibrium constituent fraction of each molecule i in the gas.

The chemical potential of C cannot be obtained directly from the model, but one has the</p><p>following relations for the partial Gibbs energies of the end members for fee iron:</p><p>Gv. = Gre GEO = Ge t+Ge (5.23)</p><p>On taking the difference between these partial Gibbs energies, one obtains for the chemical potential of C</p><p>Me = Go = GE — GEV, (5.24)  =========== 5.3.2</p><p>5.3.3</p><p>5.3 Variables for composition dependence 89</p><p>Some care should be taken when selecting components other than the elements, since it might not be possible to define a convenient reference state for the chemical potential or activity. As reference state one may use only a phase that can exist in pure form for the selected component. If solely the equilibrium state is interesting, one can ignore such problems, but one may find that the amount of the phase or the fraction of a component of a phase may be negative if the phase has a composition outside the composition range limited by the components defined by the user.</p><p>Internal degrees of freedom</p><p>In many cases a phase can have “internal” degrees of freedom that cannot be controlled externally. For example, the speciation of a gas phase at equilibrium is determined by the Gibbs energies of formation of the various gas species. A typical example is a gas formed by the elements H and O. In this gas one may at equilibrium expect to find the constituents H, H,, H,O, O, O,, and O;. For convenience one may also use H, and H,O as components rather than the elements.</p><p>Sometimes a gas is formed by mixing various amounts of particular species, but, when the equilibrium has been established, new species may have formed and the equilibrium fractions of the initial species may be very different from the initial values. In a liquid or crystalline solid there may also be a formation of species and ions on different types of sites or different types of defects. These must be taken into account when modeling the phase and the fractions of these constituents can be obtained only from an equilibrium calculation.</p><p>The constituent fraction</p><p>The species that constitute the phase are called the “constituents.” For a gas with several species the constituent fraction, y;, of each species i in the gas describes the internal equilibrium in the gas. In a crystalline phase with several sublattices the constituent fraction is often called the “site fraction.” The sum of the constituent fractions is unity (on each sublattice) and the mole fractions of the components can be calculated from the constituent fractions by using</p><p>Ll</p><p>5.25) Dj Pid) ‘</p><p>where b;, are the same stoichiometric factors as in Eq. (5.18). If there are more constituents than components one cannot obtain the constituent fractions from the mole fractions without a minimization of the Gibbs energy of the phase.</p><p>For the gas phase the partial pressure is often used to describe its composition. For an ideal gas, Dalton’s law can be applied and the partial pressure for a constituent i, p;, and the constituent fraction, y,, are related by the total pressure, p, by</p><p>Pi= PY; (5.26)  =========== 90</p><p>5.3.4</p><p>Models for the Gibbs energy</p><p>For phases with sublattices the constituent fractions, or site fractions, are defined as</p><p>5 oN! Pas (5.27)</p><p>where N{ is the number of sites occupied by the constituent i on sublattice s and N“ is the total number of sites on sublattice s. If some sites are empty, it is convenient to define a vacancy fraction</p><p>NO No y= EN iy, (5.28)</p><p>NO idVa</p><p>The vacancy, denoted Va, can be treated as a real component that always has its chemical potential equal to zero. This is a structural or constitutional vacancy, not a thermal vacancy. It is possible to have thermal vacancies in the models, too, and the fractions of such vacancies can be fitted by model parameters, but these vacancies will stabilize the phase and the lattice stability parameter for the crystalline phases has to be refitted to give the correct melting temperatures.</p><p>In this context it can be understood that it is convenient to define the molar Gibbs energy for a crystalline phase relative to the formula unit of the phase. In particular, if the phase is modeled with sublattices, which can be wholly or partially empty (i.e., containing vacancies), the molar Gibbs energy is most simply expressed per mole formula unit of the phase rather than per mole of real components.</p><p>The formula unit of a phase with sublattices is equal to the sum of the site ratios,</p><blockquote><p>, a, where the ratios a usually are the set of smallest integers giving the correct</p></blockquote><p>ratio between the numbers of sites N“ on each sublattice. It is recommended to use Cu,Mg rather than Cup ¢666667M8o.3333333 also in order to avoid rounding-off errors.</p><p>The mole fraction of the component i can be calculated from the site fractions of a crystalline phase as</p><p>Ly biy<br/>© aD, Dj buy)?</p><p>(5.29)</p><p>where b;; has the same meaning as above. The vacancies must be excluded from the summations.</p><p>Volume fractions of constituents</p><p>If the constituents have very different sizes, some may represent chain molecules with thousands of atoms whereas others have maybe only a few atoms; this must be taken into account when considering the entropy of mixing. It is common to use volume fractions in such systems, but the volume is not a very good independent variable since it depends on temperature. Instead the volume of a constituent should be used directly in the model and the composition determined in terms of the constituent fraction of the species as defined above. An example is given by the Flory—Huggins model described in section 5.9.6.  =========== 5.3.5</p><p>5.4</p><p>5.4.1</p><p>5.4.2</p><p>5.4 Modeling particular physical phenomena 91</p><p>Other fraction variables</p><p>For gases partial pressures have already been mentioned above. In aqueous solutions one frequently uses the molality as the fraction in the modeling. The molality of an aqueous species i is the number of moles of i per kilogram of solvent and it can be directly transformed to the constituent fraction of i.</p><p>Modeling particular physical phenomena</p><p>Several diverse physical phenomena may contribute to the thermodynamic properties of a phase. In some cases such contributions do not depend smoothly on the composition, but rather depend on some property that may itself vary with composition, for example the Curie temperature for ferromagnetic transitions. It is then advantageous to model these contributions separately even for the pure elements, and to model the composition dependence of the Curie temperature and similar properties as separate quantities. This introduces an “implicit” composition dependence into the Gibbs energy, which may make the equilibrium calculations more complicated but brings the modeling closer to reality.</p><p>Lattice vibrations</p><p>The contribution to the Gibbs energy due to lattice vibrations above 300K is usually close to that given by the Dulong-Petit rule, 3R7T. As already mentioned, it is not the intention here to describe models that can be extrapolated to temperatures below 298 K, but it may in some cases be important to describe the Debye temperature of a phase because that is related to other properties. A possible method to apply in order to include this was proposed at the Ringberg workshop (Chase et al. 1995). This method has still not been implemented in most software and will not be discussed further here.</p><p>A ferromagnetic transition model</p><p>Some elements and compounds undergo second-order transitions, which can be due to magnetic ordering or other internal changes without a change in composition. The sification of a second-order transition is that there is a discontinuity in the second</p><p>derivative of the Gibbs energy at the transition whereas all first derivatives, such as entropy and enthalpy, are continuous. A first-order transition means that there is a discontinuity in the first derivative. At the magnetic-transition temperature the heat capacity approaches infinity and it would be impossible to represent the heat capacity in the vicinity of the critical point using Eq. (5.2) without using many coefficients or possibly also temperature intervals. As an example of this, the heat capacity of pure iron was shown in Fig. 5.3(a). In such a case it is recommended that the contribution to the Gibbs energy due to the ‘ion in bec be modeled separately. An additional reason is that the magnetic contribution to G&#39;* in an alloy with iron is not proportional to the fraction of iron because the ferromagnetic transition is composition-dependent.</p><p>second-order trans</p><p> =========== 92</p><p>Models for the Gibbs energy</p><p>Equation (5.2) can, then, be considered to be valid for a hypothetical element or compound that does not undergo a second-order transition. For modeling a second-order transition it is necessary to start with its contribution to the heat capacity of the system. For the contribution to the heat capacity due to a magnetic transition the following empirical expressions have been proposed by Inden (1981):</p><p>len cir =x n( 42) rel (5.30) ce&quot; = KP In =) tl (531) i aa</p><p>where the superscript fm denotes the ferromagnetic state below the Curie temperature Tc. and pm the paramagnetic state above Tc; Tt is T/T¢ and T is the absolute temperature. The two coefficients K are general functions for all magnetic transitions and can be determined by integrating the heat capacities as follows:</p><p>1 « me = f Ci (n)dr + [ CPn(x)dr (5.32)</p><p>The total magnetic contribution to the molar entropy is set equal to —R In(1 + B), where B is the mean magnetic moment measured in Bohr magnetons. This is equivalent to assuming that the magnetic entropy is due to the disordering of localized spins with average magnitude equal to 8. The magnetic contribution to the Gibbs energy, ™®<em>G = ™s8G —T-™8S, vanishes at the Curie temperature, giving ™®H = T,-™</em>S. The two contributions to ™*H below and above the Curie temperature may approximately be attributed to the contributions of long-range order (LRO) and short-range order (SRO), respectively. The ratio of these two contributions is introduced as an empirical constant, p, for which Inden found the value 0.28 for cobalt and nickel (fec) and 0.4 for iron (bec).</p><p>The heat capacities cannot be integrated to give a closed expression for the Gibbs energy unless it is expanded into a power series. Thus several simplifications of the model have been proposed and the simplified version of this model due to Hillert and Jarl (1978) has been used most widely. This gives</p><p>™eG., = nRTf(7)In(B +1) (5.33)</p><p>where n is the number of atoms per formula unit that have the average magnetic moment B. The function f(7) according to the simplified model is</p><p>pet amd ee a &#39; A| 140p * 497\p 6 135 600 7</p><p>b/s pgs (7,2 477 =1 (G++) Ts</p><p>f=</p><p>with</p><p>aa S18, 169201 ~ 1125 &quot; 15975\p  =========== 5.4.3</p><p>5.4.4</p><p>5.4 Modeling particular physical phenomena 93</p><p>As already mentioned, p depends on the structure. In a solution phase 7, and B vary with the composition. For maximum flexibility and simplicity, they are assumed to vary with composition in accord with the same models as are applied to the Gibbs energy itself, as described below. The total Gibbs energy for an element or end member with a magnetic transition is thus</p><p>Gh=</p><p>hyp 4 Goamas (5.34)</p><p>where G8? is described by Eq. (5.2) and G&amp;™* by Eq. (5.33). The large effect of the ferromagnetic transition in bec Fe is clearly evident from Fig. 5.3(a). When these values are integrated to give a Gibbs energy, one can obtain the curves in Fig. 5.3(b), which show the value of the Gibbs energy relative to bec Fe extrapolated also into the metastable ranges. These curves are much smoother than the heat capacities, but an effect of the</p><p>magnetic transition is the increasing stability of bec Fe at lower temperatures.</p><p>Other physical contributions to the Gibbs energy</p><p>The contributions to the Gibbs energy from other physical phenomena, such as the electronic heat capacity, size mismatch, and short-range order, are usually not modeled separately. The reason for this is that, although some of these contributions can be accurately modeled from atomistic theories, the contributions to the Gibbs energy are in most cases much smaller than other contributions that cannot be modeled accurately. In a theoretical approach one can treat some contributions accurately but may ignore others that are equally important. In the Calphad technique the total Gibbs energy is modeled using experimental data on the phase diagram and thermodynamics to fine-tune the models to reality.</p><p>The composition dependence of physical models</p><p>The physical models with composition-dependent physical quantities, such as the Curie temperature and Bohr magneton number in the model for ferromagnetic transitions, add to the phase a Gibbs-energy contribution that is “indirectly” composition-dependent. Usually the composition dependence of the physical quantity is described with the same composition variables as the Gibbs energy itself.</p><p>The magnetic model described in section 5.4.2 has two parameters, Tc, the critical temperature for magnetic ordering, and 8, the Bohr magneton number. These can be composition-dependent in the same way as the parameters describing the chemical part of the Gibbs energy. Thus each “end member” of a solution can have a critical temperature for magnetic ordering and a Bohr magneton number. The composition dependences of these quantities are described using the same mathematical expression as that for the chemical excess Gibbs energy. Employment of particular models for other physical properties may be used more in the future.</p><p>An example of modeling the critical temperature for magnetic ordering is shown in Fig. 5.4.

Since Cr is anti- ferromagnetic, this is modeled with a negative value of the critical temperature and the curve goes through zero at some Cr content and on the Cr-rich end it represents a Néel temperature. In Fig. 5.4(b) the critical temperatures for magnetic ordering for both fcc and bee in Fe-Ni from an assessment by A.T. Dinsdale and T. G. Chart (unpublished work, 1986) are shown, with the ordered L1, phase added by I. Ansara (unpublished work, 1995). In the absence of any experimental and theoretical information when this system was assessed, the Curie temperature for bec Ni was assumed to be the same as that for fee Ni.</p><p>Models for the Gibbs energy of solutions</p><p>The term “solution” is in some contexts restricted to dilute solutions and “mixtures” used more generally, but in this book “solution” is used for all kinds of phases that can vary in composition.</p><p>All phases vary in composition to a greater or lesser extent, but for practical purposes it may be possible to ignore the compositional variations for some compounds. However, it is also important to state what the practical purpose is. For example, in electronic engineering the change in electronic properties of a semiconductor like PbS when its composition is varied over a small range is essential, but a metallurgist interested in extracting lead from a PbS ore may safely ignore this.</p><p>For solution-phase modeling it is necessary to describe the properties of the pure ele- ments or compounds that form endpoints of the solutions. In many cases the solution-phase models will also require properties for compounds that cannot be measured separately.  =========== 5.5.1</p><p>5.5 Models for the Gibbs energy of solutions 95</p><p>For that one needs estimates and models that can predict, for example, the Gibbs energy of chromium in the fcc state. These problems were discussed in section 5.2.</p><p>In order to describe real solutions, it is necessary to model the terms in Eq. (5.1) and, together with the model parameters, this can be fitted to the experimental properties of the solution. One may place the emphasis on any one of “G,,, “S,,, or ®G,,, but the main goal of the presentation in this book is to model the total Gibbs energy of a phase in such a way that it can be extrapolated to multicomponent systems.</p><p>The compound-energy formalism</p><p>There are many ways to derive the compound-energy formalism (CEF), but the original is based on the two-sublattice model formulated by Hillert and Staffanson (1970). This model was extended to an arbitrary number of sublattices and constituents on each sublattice by Sundman and Agren (1981). In order to make the mathematics easier, they introduced the concept of a “constituent array.” A constituent array specifies one or more constituents on each sublattice and is denoted J, while the individual constituents are denoted i, sometimes with a superscript (s) to denote the sublattice s. The constituent arrays can be of different orders and the zeroth order has just one constituent on each sublattice. Such a constituent array denotes a compound and this is the origin of the name compound-energy formalism. The Gibbs-energy expression for the CEF is</p><p>(5.35)</p><p>(5.36)</p><p>YP, WL, +P, WL, + (5.37) Th B</p><p>where Jp is a constituent array of zeroth order specifying one constituent in each sublattice and P;,(Y) is the product of the constituent fractions specified by Jp. °G;, is the compound- energy parameter representing the Gibbs energy of formation of the compound Jj. In many applications of the CEF some constituent arrays J) do not represent any stable compounds, which means that those °G,, must be estimated in some way.</p><p>In the configurational entropy the factor a, is the number of sites on each sublattice and y\” is used to denote the constituent fraction of i on sublattice s. The first sum is over all sublattices and the second over all constituents on each sublattice.</p><p>The excess term, *G,,,, contains sums over the possible interaction parameters defined by component arrays of the first order, second order etc. A constituent array of first order has one extra constituent in one sublattice. For the second-order constituent array it is necessary to include both the case with three interacting constituents on one sub- lattice and that with two interacting constituents on two different sublattices, i.e. a reciprocal parameter. The use of constituent arrays of higher than second order is not advisable.  =========== 96</p><p>5.5.2</p><p>Models for the Gibbs energy</p><p>The partial Gibbs energy, Eq. (2.15), takes a special form for a phase with sublattices since it might not, in the general case, be possible to calculate the partial Gibbs energy for the components unless all constituents enter in all sublattices. Nonetheless, one can always calculate the partial Gibbs energy for a constituent array of zeroth order J, as follows: &quot;AG, 0G.</p><p>Gy = Gu tL Hh -LEy (5.38)</p><p>o 1d, sal fj</p><p>ai</p><p>where the first sum is taken over the constituents i defined by the constituent array (one in each sublattice) and the second sum is over all constituents in all sublattices.</p><p>The relation between the compound and cluster energies</p><p>The CEF was developed for phases in which there are different types of atoms on the sublattices and different numbers of nearest neighbors in the sublattices, for example interstitial solutions, carbides, and intermetallic phases like the o phase. More recently it has also been used to describe order—disorder transformations in phases with the structure type B2 (CuZn) and L1, (Ni;Al) which are ordered forms of the A2 and AI structure types, respectively. In such cases there are relations between the parameters in the CEF that must be respected in order to describe the physical properties of the phase.</p><p>The basic concept of the CEF is that each compound or “end member” has independent Gibbs energy of formation. This Gibbs energy is a function of temperature and pressure but independent of composition. One may compare this with a CVM treat- ment in which the “cluster energies” may appear to be similar to the compound energies, but they depend on the composition, or volume. However, one may expand the com- position dependence of the cluster energy in the cluster fractions and obtain a separate end-member energy and an excess energy contribution. It is also possible to replace the configurational-entropy expression (5.36) by, for example, a quasi-chemical model or a tetrahedron CVM model, but, as long as the compound energies depend only on T and p. this should still be considered as a variant of the CEF.</p><p>It is not uncommon that there are no experimental data for many of the compounds or “end members.” In some cases the end members are purely fictitious, in particular when the end members are charged, like in oxides. In those cases the concept of “bond energies” may be useful and the energy of such a compound may be estimated as the sum of the energies of bonds between the atoms in the compound.</p><p>Another technique to estimate the Gibbs energy of metastable end members in the CEF is to assume that an element in a sublattice with a coordination number of 12, or smaller, will contribute the same Gibbs energy as that element has in the fcc lattice. In a sublattice with coordination number 14 or higher it will contribute the same Gibbs energy as in a bec lattice, since the second-nearest neighbors in a bec lattice are not much further away than the nearest neighbors. This has frequently been used in the modeling of many phases, for example the o phase. For example, a ternary end-member parameter can be estimated as</p><p>its own</p><p>°Ghemoni = 1O°G EE +4°GNig + 16°GNT (5.39)  =========== 5.5.3</p><p>5.5.4</p><p>5.5 Models for the Gibbs energy of solutions 97</p><p>For models of ordered phases there are usually many possible ordered compounds, but only a few that are stable and can be measured. It is possible to calculate by ab initio techniques the energies of ordered compounds, which is very useful, in particular for obtaining good extrapolations of the ordered phases to higher-order systems; see section 3.3.3. It is possible using the Connolly—Williams cluster-expansion method (Connolly and Williams 1983), or by “disordered” ab initio calculations, to obtain esti- mates of the enthalpies of a disordered phase (Abrikosov et al. 1996). Even with very good ab initio data, it is still very important to have experimental data to compare them with since some effects, such as magnetism, may cause deviations between the results of ab initio calculations and the reality.</p><p>The reference state for the Gibbs energy</p><p>There is no absolute value for the Gibbs energy, so it is necessary to refer the Gibbs energy in all phases to the same reference point for each element. Thus in Eq. (5.35) and in the following the notation °G? means the Gibbs energy of formation of the constituent array J in @ from the reference states of the elements included in the constituents and is a function of temperature and pressure,</p><p>°G</p><p>=D by HES = f(T, p) (5.40) F</p><p>where bj; is the stoichiometry factor for the component j in the constituent array J and H}*® is the enthalpy of the component j in its reference state, which is normally the stable state for the component at 298.15 K and | bar. This reference state will normally be omitted from the equations below, but, when calculating chemical potentials, it is important to know what the reference state for each component is.</p><p>The ideal-substitutional-solution model</p><p>An ideal substitutional solution means a solution of non-interacting constituents mixing randomly with each other. A special case of this is when the constituents are the same as the components. The Gibbs energy is then</p><p>Gy = 305/°G, + RTS x, Ina) (5.41)</p><p>isl isl</p><p>Usually, however, the concept of an ideal model is extended also to the case when there are constituents other than the components, for example the ideal gas, which usually has many more constituents than components. The model above should then be called the simple ideal-substitutional-solution model. The Gibbs energy of this model is</p><p>Gy = ys yi°G; 4RTS yiln(y;) (5.42)</p><p>i=l i=l  =========== 98</p><p>5.5.5</p><p>Models for the Gibbs energy</p><p>In this case the constituent fractions, y;, defined in section 5.3.3, are used rather than the mole fractions, x;, because there can be more constituents than components and because the mole fractions defined in section 5.3 are defined only for the components.</p><p>In the rest of the book, the term ideal model will mean a model in which the excess Gibbs energy, °G,,, is zero. This means that its Gibbs energy depends only on the end members and that the entropy of mixing of the constituents is random. The physical contributions are included in the ideal model.</p><p>The gas phase</p><p>The phase most often described as an ideal substitutional model is the gas phase, which usually has many more constituents than components. For example, a model for gas with the components O and H should include at least the six constituents H, H,, H,O, O, 05, and O,:</p><p>The sum of the constituent fractions is unity. If there are more constituents than components, there are internal degrees of freedom in the phase and one can obtain the values of the constituent fractions only by minimizing the Gibbs energy for the current set of conditions.</p><p>Comparing Eq. (5.42) with the general form of the Gibbs energy, Eq. (5.1), gives</p><p>The °G; parameters can, at least in principle, be determined separately for each con- stituent i, and thus there are no adjustable parameters in the ideal-substitutional-solution model which describes the properties of the solution. For a gas phase the constituents are molecules or ions and their °G; values can usually be calculated accurately from the vibrational and rotational modes of the molecule (Allendorf 2006).</p><p>It is interesting to note that it would require a very complicated excess Gibbs energy to describe the gas mentioned above with H and O using a simple ideal model based on the mixing of the atoms H and O. It is thus important to select a good “ideal” model in order to have a simple excess Gibbs energy. The shape of the Gibbs energy versus composition curve for a binary simple ideal substitutional solution is given in Fig. 5.5(a).  =========== 5.5 Models for the Gibbs energy of solutions 99</p><p>-0.1 4</p><p>-0.2 4</p><p>-0.3 4</p><p>(AT) @, (AT)</p><p>-0.44</p><p>-05 4</p><p>-06 4</p><p>A 0 02 04 O06 08 1.0 A 0 02 04 O06 08 1.0 Mole fraction B Mole fraction O</p><p>(a) (b)</p><p>Figure 5.5 Gibbs-energy curves for ideal solutions.

In (a) there are only A and B as constituents; in (b) there are several constituents. The strong “V” shape at low temperature is due to the formation of the molecule H,O. At high temperature the gas becomes more like a monatomic ideal solution with H and O as major constituents.</p><p>The total Gibbs energy of one mole of “formula units” of the gas phase is</p><p>G&amp;=Yy, a = bj HS + RT me +RT (2) (5.48) 7 7</p><p>0</p><p>Equation (5.48) is an alternative formulation of the law of mass action.

A quantum-mechanical calculation, using spectroscopic measurements, is much more accurate. This type of calculation is outside the scope of this book. The “standard pressure”</p><p>Po by convention is set to 10° Pa.</p><p>It has already been stated above that the gas phase usually has more constituents than components, i.e., there are stable molecules and thus internal degrees of freedom. It is interesting for the discussion of the model later to show how the Gibbs energy for a gas phase with the elements H and O depends on the composition for some temperatures. This is shown in Fig. 5.5(b). At low temperature the gas is either H, and H,O or O, and H,O because the Gibbs energy of formation of H,O is very strong.</p><p>Non-ideal gases are often described in terms of a Helmholtz energy rather than a Gibbs energy, i.e., using T and V as variables instead of T and p. The reason for this choice is that the critical point for the gas—liquid transition is usually important for non-ideal gases, i.e., the gas and the liquid should have the same Helmholtz energy function. The transition  =========== 100</p><p>5.5.6</p><p>5.5.7</p><p>Models for the Gibbs energy</p><p>cannot be described with a Gibbs-energy function because it represents a miscibility gap in the volume of the phase. Non-ideal gases are sometimes modeled using the fugacity; the fugacity f, of a gas constituent i is simply related to the activity by the reference pressure pp as</p><p>Si = Poti (5.49)</p><p>and this can be modeled with the excess parameters introduced below.</p><p>Ideal phases with special features</p><p>Many features are associated with an ideal phase, i.e., a phase with non-interacting constituents. The definition above in Eq. (5.42) means that a phase treated with the ideal substititional model may exhibit a number of “non-ideal” features because there can be more constituents than components. For example, the activity versus composition curve for an ideal phase is often assumed to be a straight line, but that is certainly not true for a gas with H and O, as discussed above.</p><p>Even without the formation of stable species with two or more different components in the gas, one can have “non-ideal” shapes of the activity curves; see Fig. 6.7 later for an example. The curve depends on what is selected as components, but the components selected for a system should take into account all phases, not just the gas phase.</p><p>In models discussed later one will find that there are miscibility gaps even in “ideal systems,” i.e., systems with non-interacting constituents.</p><p>The origin of non-ideal behavior of solutions</p><p>Systems with non-interacting constituents for which the surroundings of a constituent are irrelevant can be described by ideal models. In an ideal solution the bond between two unlike constituents, for example atoms in a lattice, is equal to that between two identical constituents. The simplest way to introduce a non-ideal behavior of solutions is to introduce the energy difference for these different bonds as</p><p>€,) = Ey —0.5(Ey + Ey) (5.50)</p><p>ij</p><p>If €,; is negative it means that unlike constituents prefer to be together, i.e., long- and short-range order or clustering.

This is a form of long-range order (LRO) and must be included in the modeling, as will be described in section 5.8.</p><p>The models based on the CEF do not include any explicit short-range-order (SRO) contribution. The reason for this is that a proper treatment of SRO requires the introduction of clusters, which makes the numerical solution of the equilibrium too complicated for practical applications in multicomponent materials. Another reason is that, for many important materials like steels and aluminum alloys, the contribution to the Gibbs energy due to SRO is very small. Even for alloys in which SRO is significant, for example Ni-based superalloys, the SRO contribution can be approximated in the excess Gibbs energy; see section 5.8.4.5.</p><p>It is mainly for the liquid phase that models that take SRO into account are more frequently used also in thermodynamic databases. For the liquid the pair model, like the quasi-chemical model described in section 5.7.2.1, or the associated model described in section 5.7.1, is usually sufficient.</p><p>For crystalline phases the CVM developed by Kikuchi (1951) has been used with the techniques described in this book for an assessment of the Au-Cu system (Sundman et al. 1999).

This is usually called “Henry’s law” and all models described here obey this. In some cases, when the solubility range does not exceed the range within which the activity is linear, it can be convenient to model the phase with just one parameter describing this slope. Such an activity coefficient or “Henrian” parameter, y;, for the solute i can be written</p><p>4; =e0( 4) =x, (5.54)</p><p>This model is useful for cases in which several dilute solutes in a single solvent phase are considered, for example aqueous solutions, because a single parameter is needed and simple software can be used.

In such cases it is usually simpler to use a model that relates the properties of the pure solute i in the same state as the solvent, i.e., to use a model describing the complete composition range from solvent to solute. This requires an estimation of the Gibbs energy of the solute in a metastable state and such estimates are usually available from the SGTE (Dinsdale 1991). The assessment of an interaction parameter to describe the slope in the dilute range is then identical to assessing a value of y?.</p><p>Raoult’s law applies to the solvent in a dilute solution, stating that the activity of the solvent is equal to the fraction of the solvent when the solute is dilute. All models described here obey this.</p><p>Before the advent of computers, several models useful for thermodynamic calculations using just pen and paper were developed. One of them that is still popular is the dilute- solution model of Wagner (1952). In this model an additional coefficient is introduced into Eq. (5.54) for the chemical potential of the solvent i,</p><p>My/(RT) = In(y2x)) +56: (5.56)</p><p>This equation is convenient for calculations using pen and paper but should never be used in computer calculations, since this model is inconsistent because it violates the Gibbs—Duhem relation, except in the trivial case of a binary solution.</p><p>One can compare it with the chemical potential calculated from the substitutional- regular-solution model, assuming that there are no interactions between the solutes:</p><p>HM = 9G; + RT In(x,) + (1 = 2x, +37) Ly; (5.57)  =========== 5.6</p><p>5.6 Models for the excess Gibbs energy 103</p><p>The difference is the squared term of x; in Eq.

Since large amounts of data have been obtained using the € model, in particular for the liquid phase, it can be interesting to note that both Pelton (Pelton and Bale 1986) and Hillert (1986) have developed methods by which to convert y? and €;; to a regular-solution model.

that, even converted to a regular solution, the model is limited to the dilute range of all
the solutes j in Eq. (5.59) due to Mj.

Models for the excess Gibbs energy

The excess Gibbs energy is the Gibbs energy that is “in excess” of what can be described
by “G,,, ™S,, and &quot;SG... The binary, ternary, and higher-order interactions in the
excess Gibbs energy will be described separately. All interactions will be written for
a multicomponent system in order to avoid using special features that are valid in a
lower-order system only:

Models for the Gibbs energy

Note that the excess Gibbs energy includes all contributions not included in the ideal
part, i.e., excess vibrational, excess configurational, etc.

The Gibbs energy of mixing

One should not confuse the excess Gibbs energy and the Gibbs energy of mixing. The
Gibbs energy of mixing is defined as

 

6G, = Gy —La°G

(5.63)

where the summation i is for all components of the system. The total Gibbs energy of
mixing, ™*G,,, is the difference between the Gibbs energy of the phase and that of a
mechanical mixture of the components. The excess Gibbs energy, ®G,,, in Eq. (5.1), is a
modeling quantity and equal to the difference between the Gibbs energy of the real phase
and that of whatever ideal model that has been selected.

The binary excess contribution to multicomponent systems

The basic form of the binary excess-Gibbs-energy contributions to a multicomponent
substitutional solution is

This equation is a sum over binary interactions in all i-j systems. Note that the mole
fraction of each constituent is used, i.e., there is no assumption that x; +x; = 1,
that is true only for the binary subsystem. The same equation can be used to describe the
binary excess contribution for each sublattice of a phase. The constituent fractions of the
multicomponent system should then be used in Eq. (5.64).

There are several ways to justify type of binary interaction parameter from a physical
point of view, for example by invoking the difference in bond energy between like and
unlike atoms in Eq. (5.50). If the number of nearest neighbors is z, then L;; = (z/2)€;j.
If the regular-solution parameter L,; is a temperature-independent constant, the model is
called strictly regular.

There are many extensions of this model including temperature and compo-
sition dependences and considering interactions between constituents on different
sublattices.

In Fig. 5.6 the effect of the regular-solution parameter (in units of Jmol~&#39;) on the
phase diagram for a binary system is shown. The system has only two phases, liquid
and solid. In each row the liquid has the same regular-solution parameter, +20000 in
the first row, +10000 in the second, 0 in the third, and —10000 in the last row. The
solid has a regular-solution parameter equal to +20000, +10000, and 0 in the first
and second rows, and +10000, 0, and —10000 in the third and fourth rows. With a
negative regular-solution parameter one can expect ordering, so a tentative second-order

A2/B2 type.

In Fig. 5.7 the Gibbs-energy curves for the liquid and solid phi are plotted for three
different temperatures for the case when the interaction parameter is —10000J mol~! for
the liquid and +10000Jmol!&quot;! for the solid. At 800K the liquid is stable except at the
limits and the Gibbs-energy curve for the solid phase is very flat but has no inflexion
points. At 500K the Gibbs-energy curve for the solid phase has a maximum and two
minima, but the miscibility gap is metastable since the liquid phase is stable in the middle
of the diagram. At 400K the miscibility gap in the solid phase dominates the phase
diagram and the liquid is no longer stable.

In the assessment of real systems one should expect to obtain interaction energies
approximately of the same order of magnitude in all phases modeled with a regular-
solution model. The reason for this is that the regular-solution parameter depends on the
difference in bond energies as given by Eq. (5.50), which remains approximately the
same independently of the structure of the phase.

the diagram on the right. The solid-phase interaction parameter is +20000J mol”! in the diagram

In Fig. 5.8(a) the Gibbs energy of mixing and in Fig. 5.8(b) the enthalpy of mixing
for the solid phase at 400 K are shown for some values of the regular-solution parameter.
The dotted line indicates the metastable disordered phase for the case with negative
regular-solution parameter.

In most binary systems there are also intermetallic phases, but, if these are ignored,
the general shape of the phase diagram should be close to one of those plotted. In Fig. 5.9
three phase diagrams with a compound are shown. It shows that the type of transformation
for the compound in the phase diagram depends on the parameters of all phases; it is not
a property of the compound.

The Redlich-Kister binary excess model

Equation (5.64) gives just a single interaction parameter for the phase in the binary i-j
system and that is often not enough to describe the available experimental data. One may
extend the binary regular-solution term in the composition by using differences between
the fractions of i and j:

k
Ly = Dx)&quot; Ly (5.65)

This form of the composition dependence for a binary interaction was first suggested by
Guggenheim (1937). It was recommended for use in modeling multicomponent systems
by Redlich and Kister (1948) and is generally known as a Redlich-Kister (RK) power
series. It is evident that, for a binary system, this equation can be written in many different
forms using the relation x, = 1 —x,. Other well-known expressions for the composition
dependence are Legendre polynomials, and those of Margules, Borelius, etc. However, the
form given above is recommended for use in multicomponent systems since it preserves

Models for the Gibbs energy

the shape of the excess Gibbs energy of the binary system in the multicomponent system
and only the magnitude decreases with decreasing x; + x;.

The curves in Fig. 5.10 may help the reader to understand the contributions of
the various terms in an RK series to the excess Gibbs energy. Note that the regular-
solution term is the only one that has a non-zero value in the middle of the system.
The contributions from the odd coefficients change sign in the middle whereas the
contributions from the even coefficients have the same sign throughout the whole sys-
tem. All curves are calculated for the same value of the parameter, 20000Jmol™&#39;. The
magnitude of the curves decreases because the difference in fractions is raised to a
higher power.

For reasons discussed later, one should avoid using many coefficients in an RK
series. There should be a special reason for using more than the first three. The special
name “subregular-solution model” is sometimes used when just two RK coefficients are
employed, and “subsubregular” indicates using three.

The order of i and j is important in the RK series, since the sign of the coefficients
depends on it. Various types of software may use different ways to denote the order.

A single positive regular-solution parameter will always give a symmetrical miscibility
gap, thus at least two RK coefficients are needed in order to have an asymmetrical
miscibility gap.

5.6 Models for the excess Gibbs energy 109

It is quite common that a phase is stable only within a narrow composition range. This
is usually modeled with sublattices with various types of defects based on crystallographic
and other experimental information. However, the model usually covers a much larger
composition range than the stability range of the phase. It may be tempting to limit the
composition range by using many RK coefficients, but one must be aware of the effect
of these coefficients also outside the stability range of the phase. In particular, one may
have serious problems when extrapolating a binary system with many RK coefficients
to a ternary or higher-order system because the phase may then appear at quite different
composition ranges, where the higher-order binary RK coefficients do not give a reason-
able description. This is further described in chapter 6 on assessment methodology and
in case studies in chapter 9.

The parameters ’L;; in the RK series can, of course, be temperature-dependent. Nor-
mally a linear temperature dependence is enough and only when heat-capacity data are
available may one use more:

&quot;Ly =&quot; ayy +b, T (5.66)

The composition dependence of the excess enthalpy is described by ”a,; and the excess
entropy by &quot;b,;. If measured excess-heat-capacity data are available, then and only then
may one introduce a higher-order temperature dependence into the RK coefficients. The
next higher term after the linearly temperature-dependent one should be a TIn(7) term
to represent a constant excess heat capacity.

The Redlich—-Kister power series is useful only when the excess enthalpy is a smooth
function of the constitution like for the Cu-Ni system in Fig. 5.11 from Jansson (1987).
When the enthalpy varies rapidly, like in the Mg-Sn system shown in Fig. 5.16(b) later,

 

some other modeling feature must be used.

Models for the Gibbs energy

Other binary excess parameter models

The Redlich—Kister series is the recommended excess model because it is symmetrical and
thus extrapolates well to ternary and higher-order systems. There are many other excess
models for binary systems, such as the simple polynomial, Lagrange series, etc., some of
which may also be modified to be symmetrical series. In a binary system one may always
convert from any series to another, but the ternary extrapolations will depend on the
series used, as well as on the extrapolation method; see section 5.6.6. Combining several
different binary excess series and different extrapolation methods makes it very difficult
to understand the behavior of a multicomponent system; therefore, it is not advisable.

Two versions of a phase diagram assessed without
thermochemical data

One may find published assessments using little or no thermodynamic data. Such assess-
ments should be considered with great skepticism, since it is quite easy to describe the
same phase diagram with quite different values of the thermodynamic data. See for exam-
ple the two phase diagrams in Fig. 5.12. The diagrams are very similar but the phase
boundaries represent only differences between the Gibbs energies of the phases and thus
the enthalpy curves from the two assessments are very different, as shown in Fig. 5.13.

The difference in the assessment is that in (a) an ordered model with sublattices has
been used for the intermetallic phase, whereas in (b) the intermetallic compound has been
assumed to be a substitutional model. In (a) the ordering has been assumed to be strong
at the equiatomic composition, but a large deviation from stoichiometry has been allowed
using anti-site atoms. In (b) the phases have been modeled with excess parameters as
small as possible.

Figure 5.13 In (a) and (b) the enthalpy of mixing for all phases has been calculated for the two
phase diagrams in Fig. 5.12 using ordered and disordered models, respectively. As can be seen the
enthalpy curve for the intermetallic compound in (a) is much more negative and has a pronounced
“v&quot;-shape. The activity curves calculated at 600 K for the two assessments are shown in (c) (the
full line is for the ordered model (a); the dotted line is for the disordered model (b)) and there are
significant differences.

There are hardly any differences between the phase diagrams in Fig. 5.12 and, if there
are no thermochemical measurements or crystallographic information about the type and
degree of ordering, there is no way of knowing which assessment is correct.

The sharp increase in activity at x(B) = 0.5 from the ordered model is shown in
Fig. 5.13(c) (full line). It is due to the ordering and cannot be reproduced in the dashed
curve from the assessment in which the intermetallic compound was treated as a sub-
stitutional solution. The diagrams show the simple relation between a sharp “V”-shaped
enthalpy curve and a strong increase of the chemical potential at the same composition.

The extrapolations into a ternary system from these two different assessments will
behave very differently. Thus ternary data are often a useful complement to binary
assessments with no or little data.

 

   

The ternary excess contributions

The excess ternary interaction contribution requires one more summation:

&quot;EGE YY xaxLip (5.67)

joie k=jtl

 

In some cases one would require that the ternary interaction parameter is also
composition-dependent and, as in the binary case, several methods have been suggested
as ways to handle this. However, in order to provide a symmetrical extension into higher-
order systems, Hillert (1980) suggested the following type of composition dependence in
the ternary excess parameter:

+0, Lig ty Lig (5.68)

The advantage of introducing the v; fractions is that their sum will always be unity,
even in a multicomponent system. The ternary parameter will thus behave symmetrically
when extrapolated to higher-order systems. If all &#39;L;,, are the same then that is identical
to having a composition-independent ternary parameter. A composition-independent term
in Eq. (5.68) is thus redundant.

A composition-independent ternary term would have its largest contribution where the
three fractions are as large as possible, i.e., in the middle of the constitutional triangle.
From Eq. (5.68) it is evident that the ‘L;,, will have its largest contribution toward the
corner for pure i.

Before introducing ternary or higher-order interactions, one should consider modi-
fication of the binary systems if the extrapolation to a higher-order system exhibits a
significant difference from the experimental information. Since the experimental infor-
mation is usually scarce and uncertain, it is possible to obtain equivalent descriptions of a
binary system. The binary descriptions will have different extrapolations to higher-order
systems and often ternary information is crucial for obtaining a valid binary description.

Higher-order excess contributions

As for binary and ternary interactions, more summations can be added:

p32 mtn
&quot;EGS = LY axatbia to (5.70)
GST jae kp IH

Few quaternary or higher-order parameters have been evaluated, but they would fit
into Eq. (5.70). It has not been necessary to consider composition dependences of these
parameters because there are not enough experimental data and, if there are discrepancies
in higher-order systems, one can normally correct this by reassessment of the lower-order
systems.

Extrapolation methods for binary excess models

In the derivation of the excess contributions to the Gibbs energy in Eq. (5.62) a multi-
component system considering the contribution from each of the binary, ternary, and
higher-order terms was used. In the equations one should use the fraction of each con-
stituent from the multicomponent system. One must not replace the fraction of one
constituent with one minus the sum of the rest, since that would affect the contribution
to higher-order systems. This is the simplest method of adding contributions from many
lower-order systems together and is not related to a particular solution model. However,

===========
5.6 Models for the excess Gibbs energy 113

several methods for how to add together contributions from binary systems have been
proposed on the basis of geometrical reasoning.

It may be important to point out that the choice of extrapolation model is important
only for higher-order parameters in a Redlich—-Kister series. The composition-independent
regular parameter will extrapolate in the same way independently of the extrapolation
model.

The method used in Eq. (5.62) above has been derived in a geometrical way also and
is called the Muggianu method (Muggianu et al. 1975). Alternative methods have been
suggested by Kohler (1960), Colinet (1967), and Toop (1965). The Kohler and Colinet
methods are symmetrical like the Muggianu method and treat the contributions from the
three binary systems in the same way, but refer the contributions from the binaries to
different compositions along the binary side as shown in Fig. 5.14.

The Toop method treats one of the three elements differently, but, if the other two
elements become identical, they reproduce the binary A-B = A-C systems in each ver-
tical section through the A corner. These two features, (a) symmetrical treatment of
all elements and (b) reproducing the binary systems if two elements “become” identi-
cal, cannot be combined, except in the case of composition-independent regular solu-
tions in all three binaries. The differences among the methods are usually small. The
Muggianu method has the easiest formulation, starting from the RK formalism, and thus
is preferable.

The Toop method is used when one of the constituents behaves very differently from
the others. For example, when mixing carbon or oxygen with two metals, it may be
tempting to use the Toop method since it treats the contribution from one of the binaries
differently from those from the other two. This method thus requires that constituents be
classified into different groups, which can be done with small databases, but there is no
obvious way to do this for a general database.

Pelton (2001) has devised an ingenious method to classify Toop elements for each
ternary and to combine this with other ternary extrapolation models in a multicomponent
system. This can become very complicated, so it is not recommended unless all other
methods to handle the asymmetry of a ternary system have been exhausted. First one
should try different sets of constituents, taking into account size effects, short-range order,
electronegativity, or charge transfer. There are several other modeling tools that can
handle such effects. One possibility is to add a ternary parameter that can be evaluated

from the binary excess parameters. Hillert (1980) showed that a Toop model for a ternary
A-B-C system, where C is the “Toop” element and the binary A-C and B-C systems are
modeled as subregular solutions, can be treated with the Muggianu model with a ternary
parameter evaluated from the binary systems

Lage =&#39;Lact&#39;Lpc G7)

where &#39;Lac and &#39;Lyc are the subregular-solution parameters for the A-C and B-C systems.

Ternary extrapolation models that can vary from “Kohler type” to “Toop type” depend-
ing on the relative values of binary excess Gibbs energies are not physical and would
give strange extrapolations to higher-order systems.

Modeling using additional constituents

Any solution with a strong tendency toward ordering, i.e., those in which it is energetically
favorable for unlike atoms to be close, will have a characteristic “V”-shape in its enthalpy
of mixing when the composition varies. This might not be evident from the phase diagram
shown in Fig. 5.15 for the Mg-Sn system from (Fries and Lukas 1993). The published
assessment was later modified using a new description of the hcp phase.

The activity curves will also be affected by the ordering and the activity may change by
several orders of magnitude over a small composition range. At the ordering composition
the configurational entropy will have a minimum. All these effects are shown in Fig. 5.16
for the liquid phase in the Mg-Sn system. The low entropy of mixing and the sharp
increase of the activity occur at the same composition. At higher temperatures the curves
reveal a more regular behavior of the liquid. It should be evident that this type of behavior

Figure 5.15 The phase diagram for Mg-Sn does not indicate that the liquid has any unusual

there is a strong short-range ordering in the liquid phase. The existence of the very stable
compound Mg,Sn can be taken as an indication that there may be a tendency for the liquid also to
have strong ordering around the same composition, but there are cases with stable compounds but
no short-range order in the liquid.

cannot be treated by the excess-Gibbs-energy formalism described in Eq. (5.62), which
describes a smooth change in curvature over the whole composition range.

If the excess Gibbs energy for a substitutional-solution model requires too many
coefficients to describe this behavior, it is preferable to modify the ““G,, and “™S,,
terms of Eq. (5.1). For solid phases, one may use crystallographic information to intro-
duce sublattices, as described in the next section. For liquids and for cases in which
sublattices are not possible, one may introduce fictitious constituents, usually called
associates.

Normally, fictitious constituents are used to describe short-range order (SRO), i.e., the
local arrangement of atoms, and the sublattice model to describe long-range order (LRO),
i.e., the atoms form a periodic arrangement over long distances, but there are intermediate
cases for which neither method fully describes the reality.

5.7.1

5.7.2

Models for the Gibbs energy

The associate-solution model

In systems with SRO, unlike atoms tend to stay together for a shorter or longer length
of time. The term “associate” was introduced to denote an association between unlike
atoms when the attractive forces between the atoms are not strong enough to form a
stable chemical molecule. If a molecule is formed, this should be included unproblem-
atically as a constituent in the solution. Consider, for example, the H-O system plotted
in Fig. 5.5(b), which shows the variation of the Gibbs energy with composition. The
pronounced minimum in the Gibbs energy is due to formation of H,O molecules in the
gas and there is no excess Gibbs energy.

For a system with a similar Gibbs energy or enthalpy versus composition curve to that
of a system with formation of stable molecules, the introduction of a fictitious constituent
may be reasonable. Thus the associate-solution model formally introduces an “associate”
as a constituent in the solution as a modeling tool. The associate may be considered as a
molecule not stable enough to allow its isolation, but having a lifetime still significantly

 

larger than the mean time between two thermal collisions.

Fictitious constituents, sometimes called “associates” and sometimes “clusters,” can be
used in the same form of the equation for the surface of reference of the Gibbs energy and
the configurational entropy as in Eq. (5.42). In this way one introduces a new constituent
and thus creates an internal degree of freedom. The Gibbs energy of formation of the
new constituent can be used to fit experimental data. An experimentally determined sharp
minimum in the enthalpy curve is mainly described in terms of the enthalpy of formation
of the associate. The stoichiometry of the associate must correspond to the composition
of the minimum. At that composition the constituent fraction of the associate is high and
thus the configurational entropy is low.

The contributions of the surface of reference and the configurational entropy to the
Gibbs-energy expression, Eq. (5.1), for a substitutional associated solution are

x

“1G,

(5.72)

   

og, = Ryn) (5.73)

 

where the summation over / is for all constituents. The site fraction y, is used here to denote
that the constituent fractions are not the same as the mole fractions of the components.
The excess Gibbs energy can be modeled in the same way as a substitutional solution, as
described in section 5.6, treating the interaction between each pair of constituents as an
independent parameter. Physical properties such as magnetism can be added as usual.

Non-random configurational entropy

If the interactions between the constituents are large, the random entropy of mixing used
for modeling Eq. (5.42) is not appropriate. If the interactions create a long-range ordering
of the constituents, that can be modeled with sublattices as described in section 5.8. If
the interactions create short-range ordering, its contribution to the Gibbs energy must

===========
5.7.2.1

5.7 Modeling using additional constituents 117

be modeled differently. There is interest in predicting phase diagrams using more or
less complicated, non-ideal, entropy expressions based on the “quasi-chemical” approach
or on the CVM. In these models pairwise bonds between atoms or clusters with three
or more atoms are introduced as fictitious constituents in calculating the entropy by
use of Eq. (2.11). The models include a correction term to give the correct random
configurational entropy when there is no tendency toward SRO.

The quasi-chemical model

Guggenheim proposed a model for chemical SRO called the quasi-chemical model
(Guggenheim 1952). To derive this model, one may start by assuming that the bonds
between A and B atoms, giving molecules AA, BB, and AB, are distributed randomly.
The formation of the bonds is described by a simple chemical-reaction formula that can
be written as a Gibbs energy of reaction for the molecules AA, BB, and AB:

AA+BB =AB+BA (5.74)

As with the associate model, this can be treated by introducing additional “fictitious”
constituents into a substitutional-solution model, in this case both AB and BA. The reason
for having two constituents with the same stoichiometry is due to the fact that they do not
represent free molecules as in the gas or liquid, but bonds in a crystalline solid, where the
orientation of the bond is important. The exchange of an A and a B atom between two
neighboring sites affects the entropy because other bonds are changed by this exchange.

For a phase with the number of bonds per atom equal to z and ignoring the fact that
the bonds should agree on the atom placed at each site, the Gibbs-energy expression for
the “bonds” AA, BB, AB, and BA is

“Guy = Yan’Gan + Yon°Gpp + Yan°Gas + Yoa°Goa (5.75)

&quot;Sy = RS [an In(yaa) + Ypp (pe) + Yas Man) + Yea Mea) (5.76)
The mass-balance constraints give the mole fractions of A and B as

X,=Yaa $0505 +Ypa) (5.77)

y= Yep +0.5(Yan + Ya) (5.78)

In the expression for the surface of reference, &quot;Gag = °Gg, due to symmetry. If
Yas = Yea there is no LRO and this “degeneracy” in the disordered state, due to its
distinguishing the fractions of y,g and ygq, gives an additional term RTy,, In2 compared
with the case on ignoring this degeneracy. In the expression for “&#39;S,, the configurational
entropy is overestimated considerably because the number of bonds is z/2 times larger
than the number of atoms per mole and, for the case &quot;Gz = 0, the entropy should become
identical to that of an ideal solution of the components A and B.

The origin of this overestimate can be understood if z = 2 in Eq. (5.76) because it is
then identical to the entropy of a gas phase with AA, BB, BA, and AB. In a gas phase

 

===========
118

5.7.2.2

Models for the Gibbs energy

the molecules are independent and can rotate freely, but in a crystalline phase the nearest
neighbors to a site must agree what atom is placed in that site. In order to correct for the
overestimation of the entropy in Eq. (5.76), the following modified entropy expression
was suggested by Guggenheim (1952):

Sy = -R5 [ons wo(25*) + pp n(4&quot;) +Yap n( 22) +Yba n( tha )
2 a a Xatp XAtp

— R[xq In(x,) +p In(xg)] (5.79)

 

 

  

For the case of no SRO this expression gives the same configurational entropy as a
random mixing of the atoms A and B. This is the final entropy expression according to the
quasi-chemical model and also to the simplest Ising model, but, even with this correction,
Eq. (5.79) is valid only when the degree of SRO is small. If the ordering is strong and
z &gt; 2, one may even have negative values of “&#39;S,, from Eq. (5.79); see Fig. 5.17(b) later.

When the SRO is very strong, it can be treated as LRO, which can be described with
the sublattices introduced in section 5.8. A connection between the quasi-chemical model
and the sublattice model is described in section 5.8.4.3.

One can easily verify that Eq. (5.79) is identical to a random-entropy model when
there is no SRO. For this case the constituent fractions can be calculated from the mole
fractions:

Yaa =

(5.80)

Yas = Yaa =

 

YBB

On inserting Eq. (5.80) into Eq. (5.79), this becomes identical to an ideal solution in
Eq. (5.41). This is in contrast to the associate model, in which an ideal configurational
entropy of all constituents is assumed and the configurational entropy will never be
identical to that of an ideal solution without the associate.

The cluster-variation method

In the CVM formalism developed by Kikuchi (1951), one introduces clusters with three,
four, and more atoms and, depending on the crystal structure, one can derive corrections
to the entropy expression taking into account the fact that the clusters are not independent.
However, the principle is the same as for the quasi-chemical formalism, namely that
these clusters can be treated as independent constituents with a unique fraction, but, for
the configurational entropy, one must take into account the fact that the clusters share
corners, edges, surfaces, etc. The configurational entropy is different for each different
crystal structure and the CVM configurational entropy for an fcc lattice in the tetrahedron
approximation is given below. For the case in which there is no LRO, there are five
constituents or “clusters,” A, Ag75Bo25, AgsBo5, Ao.25Bo7s, and B. One may use the
stoichiometry as fraction indices as long as there is no LRO. These five clusters all
represent tetrahedra in the fee structure and are the end members of the phase. The

FYaqsBo5sM(vag 5895) + YaoasBo.15 IM(YAgasBo5) + YB In(ye)] (5.82)

In a crystal the clusters are not independent, but share edges and corners. They must
thus agree on the type of atom placed in each site and that reduces the configurational
entropy compared with that of an ideal gas. This correction can only be approximate and,
with the CVM tetrahedron approximation, the following expression is used:

CVMenty _ pidentg 4 oie g
+6R[Paa In(Paa) + Pas (Pap) + Poa n(Ppa) + Poe nPop)

—SR[xq In(xq) + Xp In(xp)] (5.83)

The term “8S,, is due to the fact that the 5 clusters above are degenerate cases of
the 16 clusters needed to describe LRO (4 different Ap.7sBo25, 6 different ApsBos, and
4 different Ap »5Bo.75). This means adding

°8S yy = —RL(agzs80.25 + Yaoasbn.75)1M(4) + Yang 80.5 11(6)] (5.84)

The variable p,, is a pair probability that is equal to the bond fraction in the quasi-
chemical-entropy expression. The values of pa, etc. can be calculated from the cluster
fractions as

1
Par = Yat O-5YagzsBo2s + EY AnsBos

1
Pas = Yet 0.5YagasBo75 + EYAo Bos

and the mole fractions from the pair probabilities as

Xa = Paat Pas (5.86)
*p = Pas + Pea
The equations for p,, etc. are easily understood if one realizes that, in a tetrahedron

cluster, there are six bonds and that in an Ap 7;Bo 5 cluster half of these bonds are between
A atoms, whereas in an Aj ;B,,; cluster only one is between A atoms.

In Fig. 5.17(a) the Gibbs-energy curves for three related models have been calculated
for an A-B system using the same nearest-neighbor bond energy just above the tem-
perature for LRO. One curve is for a substitutional regular-solution model, Eq. (5.64),
with ideal configurational entropy Eq. (5.41); one for an associated-solution model with
five constituents, A, Ap 75Bo25, AosBos, Ao2sBo7s, and B, Eqs. (5.72) and (5.73); and
one for a CVM tetrahedron model, Eqs. (5.81) and (5.83) with the same clusters as the
associates. In the second and third of these models no excess Gibbs energy is used, but
the same constant Gibbs energies are used for the associates or clusters. It is clear that
the associate model overestimates the contribution of SRO to the Gibbs energy.

In Fig. 5.17(b) the Gibbs energies at equiatomic composition for the CVM tetrahedron

way down to 0K for both models. The CVM extrapolation has an unphysical negative
entropy at low temperatures. This means that one must be careful using models like the
modified quasi-chemical model for liquids that cannot undergo a transition to LRO; see
section 5.9.3.1.

In general the cluster energies in the CVM depend on the composition, whereas the
end-member energies used in the CEF have fixed energies representing a phase with
exactly the composition and structure of the end member. In the CEF the dependence on

composition is modeled with the excess Gibbs energies and this method requires fewer
composition variables than does the CVM. As a comparison, a CVM tetrahedron model
for fcc with eight elements must have at least 8&#39; = 4096 clusters or constituents whereas
a four-sublattice CEF model, which can describe the LRO just as well as CVM can
and with a reasonable SRO approximation, requires only 8 x 4 = 32 constituents. This
means that a CEF model will be several orders of magnitude faster than a CVM model
to implement in three-dimensional software for simulations of phase transformations, for
example.

The excess Gibbs energy with additional constituents

Even with fictitious constituents, Eq. (5.1) can be applied with an excess term given
by Eq. (5.62) and the summations are made including the fictitious constituents. Intro-
ducing a fictitious constituent into a binary substitutional solution allows one to treat
this formally as a ternary system and evaluate binary interactions of all three con-
stituents. From the mathematical point of view, this is not a problem, but of course
the software for calculation of the equilibrium must handle the m:
properly.

A simple case of introducing associates is the model for the Mg—Sn system. The liquid
exhibits a high degree of SRO at the Mg,Sn composition and, in order to describe this,

There are three excess interaction parameters that describe each “binary” side of the constitu- tional triangle shown in Fig. 5.18. In this diagram, which looks like a ternary system, for the Mg-Sn system, taken from an assessment by Fries and Lukas (1993), the full lines show how the constitution of the liquid phase varies with composition at several temperatures. In these cases the parameter Ly,,.s, is usually zero because the fractions of Mg and Sn are never high simultaneously. One may include a “ternary” interaction</p><p>Lvig.sn.Mg3Sn* Note that the selection of the associate is very important, the model will behave differently if one selects as a model (Mg, Sn, Mg/;Snj)3).</p><p>Modeling using sublattices</p><p>In crystalline solids it is important to take into account that the atoms may occupy different types of sublattices with different coordination numbers, bond lengths, etc. Sublattices represent LRO, which will modify both the entropy expression and the excess Gibbs energy. The simplest case of a sublattice model would be two sublattices with two constituents in each. A shorthand notation of this would be</p><p>(A,B) (C.D), (5.90)</p><p>where the subscripts m and n give the ratio of sites on the two sublattices. In a crys- talline solid m and n are fixed numbers, but one may chose to extract a common factor determining the size of the formula unit of the phase. It is advisable to use the smallest possible integer numbers for the site ratios. The constituents A, B, C, and D can represent atoms, ions, anti-site atoms, vacancies, etc. The most general formalism for describing thermodynamic properties of phases with two or more sublattices is the CEF, which is given by Eqs. (5.35)-(5.37).</p><p>The very simplest case of using two or more sublattices is when there is a single component on either sublattice. That represents a stoichiometric phase and is not different from having a single species as constituent. The case of mixing on one sublattice and a single constituent on the other is identical to mixing species in the substitutional model, although some care has to be taken about the stoichiometry of the species in order to obtain a reasonable configurational entropy.  =========== 5.8.1</p><p>5.8 Modeling using sublattices 123</p><p>Reciprocal solutions</p><p>A simple case, which cannot be modeled as a substitutional model, is that of a phase with two sublattices and two constituents on each sublattice. This is known as a reciprocal system because of the reaction</p><p>An Cu + BmDy = AnDy + BnCy 6.91) The reciprocal energy represented by this reaction is</p><p>AG = Gace +°Gpn — Gav — Gare (5.92)</p><p>An example of this type of reaction occurs on mixing the salts NaCl and KBr: NaCl+KBr = NaBr + KCI (5.93) In the reciprocal model, just like in the CEF, one assumes ideal configurational entropy on each sublattice separately and the total entropy is weighted with respect to the number of sites on each sublattice. The sublattice model thus gives a different behavior of the configurational entropy from that given by a substitutional model. The first two terms of</p><p>Eg.

The reference energy expression has four terms representing the possible four compounds obtainable by combining the constituents on the two sublattices. The Gibbs energy of formation of these compounds °G;.; is multiplied by the fractions of one constituent from each sublattice. Note that a colon is used to separate constituents on different sublattices in the parameter expression. For clarity, two constituents on the same sublattice will sometimes be separated by a comma.</p><p>The configurational entropy is calculated from Eq. (2.11) assuming random mixing on each sublattice and multiplying this by the site ratios. The excess term, *G,,, will be discussed in the next section. Already without any excess terms, i.e., an ideal reciprocal model, there are some specific features.</p><p>In Fig. 5.19(a) the constitutional square is shown and the four corner compounds are indicated. If the reciprocal model is used for a binary system, the constituents on the two sublattices can be the components, species or ions formed by the components or vacancies. The Wagner—Schottky model described in section 5.8.2.3 is one of the most important examples of the use of this model. Many examples of the application of the two-sublattice model will be described in other sections.</p><p>For the reciprocal model one may be able to calculate partial Gibbs energies not for the components but only for end members as defined in section 5.5.1.

In the excess parameter one will thus start with three fractions multiplied by each other, two from one sublattice and one from the other. Additionally there is a reciprocal excess parameter that is multiplied by all four fractions:</p><p>®Gm = Ya¥eNeLawc + Ye YvLABD +YACMLac + YgverLwco + Y YpLawco (5-97)</p><p>There are two “binary” interaction parameters for each sublattice depending on the constituent on the other sublattice and these are related to the four sides of the constitu- tional square in Fig. 5.19(a). The reciprocal parameter will have its largest influence in the center of the square. In Fig. 5.26 in the section 5.9.4 the surface of reference for a reciprocal system is shown.  =========== 5.8.1.2</p><p>5.8 Modeling using sublattices 125</p><p>The binary interaction parameters can be expanded in an RK formula, Eq.

With three or more sublattices, however, the excess Gibbs energy is less important since the major part of the Gibbs energy is described by the parameters in the surface of reference, °G;.</p><p>The reciprocal miscibility gap</p><p>The reciprocal sublattice model has an inherent tendency to form a miscibility gap in the middle of the system. When the reciprocal Gibbs energy, AG in Eq. (5.92), is sufficiently large this will create a phase separation with the tie-lines parallel to the diagonal and with the largest energy difference between the corner compounds. This miscibility gap can appear without any excess parameters and it cannot be suppressed completely even by adding excess parameters. Even the reciprocal parameter might not suppress the miscibility gap, but may just separate it into two smaller ones.</p><p>When there are experimental data on the Gibbs energies of the corner compounds, the appearance of the miscibility gap is usually predicted reasonably well by the reciprocal model with no or small excess energy. However, if one or two of the corners represent metastable or purely fictitious compounds that must be estimated, it is often difficult to control the appearance of this miscibility gap.</p><p>When there are no data for an end member of a reciprocal solution, it is often useful to estimate using the assumption that the AG in Eq. (5.92) is zero, i.e., the end member (A:C) representing a fictitious compound can be estimated by</p><p>p+ °Gge- (5.100)</p><p>In this way one can avoid problems with reciprocal miscibility gaps. If several end members are fictitious and cannot be estimated in any other way, one should start by estimating the one which is most significant. One should also take care about compound energies that might not be specific to a particular system. In particular, the parameters for compounds with some sublattices filled with vacancies may be part of other systems and it is then important to estimate the values of such parameters by incorporating all available information, just as when determining the lattice stabilities for the elements.  =========== 126</p><p>5.8.2</p><p>5.8.2.1</p><p>Models for the Gibbs energy</p><p>To avoid the presence of a reciprocal miscibility gap, Hillert suggested the use of a special reciprocal parameter,</p><p>©G = JapopLapcy (5.101)</p><p>This can completely suppress the miscibility gap and can be added to the normal excess Gibbs energy, for the expression Eq. (5.97). Since there is no physical reason for this composition dependence, it must be considered as a curve-fitting parameter.</p><p>The reciprocal miscibility gap is often decreased by short-range ordering in the system. It is possible to derive an approximation to this contribution, as was first done by Pelton and Blander (1986) for molten salts. It was later extended to solid phases by Sundman et al. (1998). The reciprocal parameter is expressed as a function of the reciprocal energy, AG in Eq. (5.92), as</p><p>(5.102)</p><p>Lascn =</p><p>The factor z is the number of nearest neighbors. This parameter has also been used successfully by Frisk er al. (2001) for modeling carbides and nitrides, for which many end members are not stable and their Gibbs energies thus must be estimated.</p><p>In Fig. 5.19(b) the reciprocal miscibility gap in a phase modeled as (A, B)(C, D) is shown as a dotted line. This miscibility gap is calculated with a AG parameter according to Eq. (5.92) only and no excess parameters. Adding a reciprocal parameter according to Eq. (5.102) changes the miscibility gap into five different ones, which are shown by the full lines.</p><p>Models using two sublattices</p><p>In this section we consider a number of models that can be described with the two- sublattice CEF.

Owing to the difference in size, these elements prefer to occupy the interstitial sites in the metallic sublattices.

(5.103) is the vacancy. This was already introduced in Eq. (5.28) and the vacancy can be treated just like any other “real” constitent if its chemical potential is always equal to zero, and it is excluded from the summation to calculate the mole fractions, Eq. (5.29).</p><p>Some carbides, nitrides, and borides have the B1 structure (TiC, VN, etc.) and they can be treated with the same model as austenite, i.e., the fec phase. A model for B1 as both metal and carbon-nitride—boride phases in a multicomponent steel is</p><p>(Fe, Cr, Ni, Ti, ...):(Va, C, N, B); (5.105)</p><p>In Thermo-Cale two “composition sets” of the fec phase can be used if both the metallic phase (with mainly vacancies in the interstitial sublattice) and the carbide are stable in the same system. Usually the carbide is the second composition set, but, after a calculation, one may have to list the compositions of the phases in order to know which composition set is metallic or carbide.</p><p>Models for phases involving metals and non-metals</p><p>Many phases involving a metallic element and a non-metal like carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen are modeled with one sublattice for the metallic elements and another for the non-metal. Some examples are the cubic carbo-nitride mentioned above, and the M,C; carbide. In some cases there is more than one crystallographically different sublattice for the metallic element, but there are normally not enough experimental data to describe this.

This model will be discussed further in section 6.2.5.8.</p><p>The Wagner-Schottky defect model</p><p>The Wagner-Schottky model (Wagner and Schottky 1930) describes the variation of the Gibbs energy of formation of a compound within a small composition range as a function  =========== 128</p><p>Models for the Gibbs energy</p><p>of various types of defects. The model contains only three parameters, the Gibbs energy of formation of the ideal compound and the Gibbs energies of formation of two defects, allowing a deviation from stoichiometry on both sides of the ideal composition. This model can be described in the CEF as a reciprocal model with four end members. If the ideal constituents are called A and B and the defects X and Y, the model will be</p><p>(A, X),(B, Y), (5.108)</p><p>where a and b are the stoichiometry ratios. The defects can be</p><p>(1) _anti-site atoms, i.e., B atoms on the sublattice for A and A atoms on the sublattice for B;</p><p>(2) vacancies;</p><p>(3) _ interstitials; or</p><p>(4) a mixture of the above defects.</p><p>If interstitial defects are important, one must in CEF add a sublattice for these and specify how many sites there are in this interstitial sublattice and that the normal con- stituent on the interstitial sublattice is the vacancy. For example, if the main type of defect is that both A and B prefer to appear as interstitials on the same interstitial sublattice, one has the model</p><p>(A), (B),(Va, A, B). (5.109)</p><p>The crystal structure for the phase provides additional information. For example, in some compounds with the B2 structure type, i-e., ordered bee with two identical sublattices, one often has anti-site atoms on one side of the ideal composition and vacancies on the other. This means that it is tempting to use a model of the form</p><p>(A,B), (B, Va); (5.110)</p><p>but the two sublattices are crystallographically identical, which means that, if the atoms in the two sublattices are interchanged, the crystal is still the same and the ideal compound can equally well be written BA as AB. For this reason one must include all defects on both sublattices; allowing both anti-site atoms and vacancies the model should be</p><p>(A,B, Va); (B, A, Va); (5.111)</p><p>One should take into account that B2 is an ordered form of the bec lattice.

When the number of real atoms approaches zero the Gibbs energy per mole of atoms becomes zero divided by zero, which can give very large negative values and thus make a bec phase consisting mainly of vacancies very stable. Other arguments are that one should consider it as a phase full of defects and use a very large positive number to suppress the thermal vacancies. The present recommendation is to use a reasonably large positive value like 307 in order to avoid numerical problems and fit an interaction parameter to describe the real vacancy fraction.</p><p>It is important to model the B2 phase in a compatible way in each binary since one often has solubilities of ternary elements across the whole composition range, for example in Al-Fe-Ni; see section 3.3.3. In this ternary system the model for the B2 phase must include the disordered bec phase as a special case. More about modeling ordered phases can be found in section 5.8.4.</p><p>A model for L1,/A1 ordering</p><p>The Al structure type is shown in Fig. 5.21(a) together with some ordered structures. The L1, ordering means that the eight corner atoms are of a different kind from the atoms on the sides. This gives an ideal stoichiometry A,B and initially this was modeled with two sublattices, (A, B);(A, B),. In this model the constituents in the sublattice with three sites have eight nearest neighbors in the same sublattice. This means that there is a relation between the Gibbs energy of formation °G,., and the interaction parameters Lag. since both are related to the bonding energy of the nearest neighbors. The recommended way to model ordering on the fcc lattice is to use four sublattices, as described in section 5.8.4.4. A problem with using the two-sublattice model in an assessment of an L1, ordering is that it may predict an ordered L1, ordering if the parameters are converted to a four-sublattice model.</p><p>The L1, phase is the most important ordered fec phase and it may be practical to use the two-sublattice model for multicomponent systems. There are rather compli- cated restrictions on the parameters that are needed in the two-sublattice model sub- lattice. The method employed to convert from a four-sublattice model is described in section 5.8.4.6.  =========== 134 Models for the Gibbs energy</p><p>(b) (c)</p><p>Figure 5.21 The disordered Al (a) and ordered L1 (b) and Ly (c) variants of the fee lattice.

An exception is when there are crystallographic relations between the parameters, as in the case of chemical ordering. In the next section a four-sublattice model for ordering on the fcc lattice will be described.</p><p>Models for intermetallic phases</p><p>Some intermetallic phases have been modeled with three sublattices, the most well known perhaps being the o and the w phases (Fig. 5.22). In both cases the crystallographic information has been simplified in the thermodynamic modeling. The o phase has five different crystallographic sublattices, but only three are used in the modeling. The main reason for this is that there is not enough experimental information to evaluate all neces- sary parameters for a five-sublattice model. Such information would be the distributions of the various components on the sublattices, which are rarely known. In the o phase the first sublattice is mainly occupied by fcc-type elements, the second by mainly bec-type elements, and the third is a mixture of all.</p><p>The composition range of the intermetallic phase is important to consider when decid- ing on the sublattices. If the intermetallic phase appears in several systems, all of these should be considered before selecting a model. The constituents of a sublattice would normally be those which can be the only constituent on that sublattice, but, in order to describe the composition range, it may be necessary to include some components as “defects” in sublattices that they normally would not enter. However, this may increase the number of parameters significantly in multicomponent systems and should be done with care. Sometimes one may accept an error of a few percent in the composition range in a lower-order system in order to simplify the multicomponent description.</p><p>It is important for the development of a general thermodynamic database that all agree to use the same set of sublattices when modeling a phase. In the second Ringberg report Ansara et al. (1997a) presented a survey and recommendations regarding the mod- eling of many intermetallic compounds. For example, they recommended that the o phase be modeled with three sublattices and the site ratios 10:4: 16, not 8:4: 18 as had been</p><p>Figure 5.22 The crystal structures of o (left) and L2, (right) phases.

The reason for the earlier model was to simplify the description of the composition range of the o phase in the Ni-V system and to describe the composition range of the o phase in the Cr—Fe—Mo system.</p><p>The possibility of using ab initio calculations to obtain values for metastable end members in intermetallic phases is rapidly becoming an important source of information, for example on the Re-W (Fries and Sundman 2002) and Cr—Fe (Korzhavyi et al. 2005) system. Since the CEF can use the energies calculated for the ordered end members directly without any cluster-expansion approximation and because SRO is insignificant in these phases, the combination of the CEF and ab initio methods amounts to an important step forward for the development of new materials.</p><p>The availability of improved experimental techniques such as Rietveld refinement (Joubert 2002) also means that additional information on site occupancies and defect fractions has become available to use in the modeling of phases. The experimental determination of the site occupancy of the j. phase in the Nb-Ni system showed that none of the previous models, which had been selected arbitrarily or on the basis of coordination-number arguments, coincides with the one revealed by the experimental results (Joubert and Feutelais 2002).</p><p>Models for metal-non-metal phases</p><p>The M,;C, phase is an example of a phase that has been modeled with two sublattices for the metallic elements and one for the carbon, in order to treat the limited solubility of the heavy elements W and Mo in a proper way. The crystallographic information would give (Cr, Fe, . . . )»,(Cr, Fe, W, Mo, . . . )»Cg, but it was not followed entirely since that would not have described the full composition range. Instead a model of the form (Cr, Fe, .. . )xo(Cr, Fe, W, Mo, . . . );Cs was adopted.</p><p>Many oxide phases have different types of metallic sublattices, for example the spinel phase. In this phase the oxygen ions form an fcc lattice and the metallic ions enter some of the tetrahedral and octahedral interstitial sites. A four-sublattice model has been adopted for this phase, which can also describe the wide stability range of the spinel phase in the MgO-AI,O, system.</p><p>An interesting application of the three-sublattice model is to the Fe—Al-C system. In the ferrite phase, carbon dissolves interstitially and Fe—Al can form a B2 ordered structure. This means a combination of two sublattices for ordering of the metallic elements with one extra sublattice for interstitials. Some care must be taken with the model parameters to ensure that the disordered phase remains stable, but, using the partitioning as described in section 5.8.4.1, that is no problem.</p><p>Models for phases with order-disorder transitions</p><p>The sublattice model can describe phases that exhibit ordering of the metallic constituents on different sublattices that may disappear above a certain temperature or beyond a partic- ular composition, for example the B2/A2 transition already mentioned in section 5.8.2.4, the L1,/A1 transition in section 5.8.2.5, and the four-sublattice models in sections 5.8.4.4  ===========</p><p>5.8 Modeling using sublattices 137</p><p>and 5.8.4.7. If one restricts the model parameters to just the ideal model without excess parameters, the sublattice model is identical to the Bragg—Williams—Gorsky treatment of ordering, but with the excess parameters in the CEF one may reproduce the real properties of the ordering transformation better.</p><p>In the disordered state the constituents are distributed equally but randomly on the sublattices. In the ordered state the constituents have different fractions. This degeneration of the two or more ordered sublattices into a single one enforces several restrictions on the possible parameters in the CEF, otherwise the disordered state would never be stable. These restrictions are based on the requirement that the Gibbs energy of the phase must have an extremum against variations in the ordering variables at the disordered composition. In the disordered state such a requirement is self-evident and the extremum must be a minimum, otherwise the phase would undergo ordering. Such requirements were first derived by Ansara et al. (1988).</p><p>In some cases the ordered phase is described with a different Gibbs-energy expression from that used for the disordered phase. The ordered phase will then normally never be completely disordered. Such a treatment of ordered phases is not recommended in general, although some ordered structure types, such as D0,, and L2), see Fig. 5.22 and section 5.8.4.7, may require too many sublattices for it to be practically reasonable to treat them with a single mathematical expression.</p><p>The configurational entropy for a phase with an order—disorder transition may deviate considerably from the ideal entropy used in the sublattice model. However, from a practical point of view these differences can be modeled in terms of the excess Gibbs energy without losing any agreement with experimental data, although one may suspect that the extrapolations based on these simplifications may be less accurate than a proper treatment of the configurational entropy. For future work it is recommended that models making use of the CVM, see section 5.7.2.2, or similar techniques should be considered for phases with order—disorder transitions.</p><p>The disordered state of an ordered phase</p><p>For phases modeled with an order—disorder transition like the B2/A2 case in section 5.8.2.4 both the ordered and the disordered state can be described with a single Gibbs-energy function.

Also when extrapolating binary systems with and without ordering to a ternary system this model requires that the parameters derived for the substitutional model for the disordered phase be converted to the two-sublattice model. This can always be done by replacing the mole fractions by the appropriate site fractions,</p><p>xX, = 0.50, +yK)</p><p>y= 0.5(y% +98) (5.143)</p><p>but it is rather cumbersome for multicomponent systems.</p><p>These were the reasons for introducing a “partitioning” of the Gibbs energy for an ordered phase into one part that is independent of the ordering and one that describes the contribution to the Gibbs energy due to ordering.</p><p>Partitioning of the Gibbs energy for ordered phases</p><p>For phases with order—disorder transitions the partitioning of the Gibbs-energy expression is into two parts, a general part, which depends only on the composition of the phase, expressed as mole fractions x, and another part giving the contribution due to long-range ordering, depending on the site fractions y:</p><p>(x) +AG&amp;(y) (5.144) The first term, G¢&#39;(x), is independent of the ordering state of the phase. The second term, AG&quot;, gives the contribution due to long-range ordering and must be zero when the phase is disordered. The simplest way to ensure that AG¢™ is zero in the disordered state is to calculate this contribution as AG*(y) = G&quot;(y) — G&quot;(y replaced by x) (5.145) In Eq. (5.145) the parameter describing the ordering, Ge&quot;, is first calculated with the original site fractions, y, which describe the ordering. The site fractions are then set equal to the mole fractions, x, which means that each constituent has the same site fraction in  =========== 5.8.4.3</p><p>5.8 Modeling using sublattices 139</p><p>all sublattices, and the value of the expression is calculated again. The difference is the contribution to the Gibbs energy due to ordering. If the phase was originally disordered, the two terms will be equal and the difference will be zero.</p><p>Ordered phases become less ordered with increasing temperature. Above a certain temperature LRO may disappear completely, but some SRO will remain even in the disordered state. If the ordered phase has no order-disorder transition within the experi- mental range, for example the ordered phase may melt before it disorders, there is a certain arbitrariness in the distribution of the Gibbs energy between Gés(x) and Ge&quot;(x). It may be possible to resolve this using ab initio calculations.</p><p>An important advantage of this partitioning is that it is much easier to combine assessments, including assessments of both ordered and disordered descriptions of a phase. If a system has a disordered contribution only, that is added to the Gs part and no parameters are needed for the G2&quot; part.</p><p>It is important to understand that the partitioning of the Gibbs energy into an ordered and a disordered part is not a new model; the Gibbs-energy expression can always be written using the site fractions only. It is a simplification that is useful for calculations of ordered phases in multicomponent systems.</p><p>The quasi-chemical model and long-range order</p><p>An interesting connection with the quasi-chemical model for SRO is that one can calculate site fractions for a two-sublattice model from the “bond fractions” yay, Yap. Yea, and Ypp as Ya = Yaa t+ Yap Je = Yeat Yep Ya = Yaa tba (5.146) Je = Yas +Ybp Note that it is essential to treat yg and yga as different, otherwise one cannot describe the long-range ordering. This means that a quasi-chemical model can be formally treated as a two-sublattice model, but in addition it includes a contribution from SRO.

Note the problem with nega- tive entropies for large SRO shown in Fig. 5.17(b) if one uses a quasi-chemical model without allowing for LRO. Models for crystalline phases with explicit SRO are based on the CVM, see section 5.7.2.2; models with implicit SRO are described in section 5.8.4.5.</p><p>Simultaneous L1, and L1, ordering</p><p>With four sublattices one may model both LI, and L1, ordering on the fee lattice. Actually, there are many more ordered structures based on the fcc lattice, but most of them can be treated as separate phases with different Gibbs-energy expressions. The restriction that these phases will never undergo disordering is usually a minor problem.</p><p>In the four-sublattice model the restrictions on the parameters can be derived fairly easily from the symmetry of the lattice. For example,</p><p>“Gavan = Gaawa =&quot;Gasaca = &quot;Gaaiaca</p><p>“Gasan = “Gapan = &quot;Goan = &quot;Gana = &quot;Goan = &quot;Goma:</p><p>“Geawa = “Gooan = &quot;Gone =&quot;Ganse (5.148) SLaBvcA = “Lavaca = Lyarap:a = &quot;Laacnas</p><p>The L1, and L1, ordering and also the disordered Al phase can be described with the same model. Normally the Gibbs energy is partitioned into a disordered and an ordered part as described in section 5.8.4.2. The L parameters above are then normally not used since they can be described in the disordered part. If one assumes that the bond energy between AB pairs, u,g, depends only slightly on the composition, one can write the G parameters as follows:</p><p>°Grrne = Gays = 3ttan + Ary</p><p>°Ga.a5:8 = Gayp, = Allan (5.149)</p><p>“Gxs65 = Gas, = 3uay + Aur</p><p>The factors of 3 and 4 above come from the number of AB bonds in each end member. The bond energy may be different when the overall composition is different and thus the terms Au, and Au, can be used as corrections to fit the experimental data.</p><p>It is a critical test that one has used a correct set of parameters that the disordered phase can really be disordered, i-e., that all site fractions on all sublattices are equal at some high temperature. If there is a deviation, even a small one, then probably one or more parameters are missing or have wrong values.  =========== 5.8.4.5</p><p>5.8 Modeling using sublattices 141</p><p>Approximation of the short-range-order contribution to the Gibbs energy</p><p>The SRO contribution to the Gibbs energy of the fcc phase can be approximated with a reciprocal parameter as shown in Eq.

The ideal composition of a B32 ordered phase is AB, as for B2, but not all nearest neighbors are different. The ideal composition of a DO; ordered phase is A,B, as for L1,, but, in contrast to L1, ordering, the DO, ordering does not have identical surroundings in the three sublattices with the majority constituent.  =========== 5.8.5</p><p>5.8 Modeling using sublattices 145</p><p>One difference between the four-sublattice models for ordering in bec and fee phases is that the bec ordering requires two bond energies, both nearest and next-nearest neighbors are important. In B2 ordering it is sufficient to have two sublattices, one with the central atom, the other with the eight corner atoms. In DO; ordering one must consider eight bec unit cells and each of the previous sublattices is split into two new ones in such a way that the atoms on the same sublattice are arranged diagonally. The four sublattices must be grouped two and two since all nearest neighbors are on two of the sublattices and all next-nearest neighbors on the third. If sublattices 1 and 2 have no nearest neighbors and neither do sublattices 3 and 4, the compound energies are</p><p>Gavan = Bad = Gpaaa 2€an + Tap</p><p>Gyxne = Gowaa4éas (2) (5.160)</p><p>°Gawaw = Gapaa = &quot;Gpacan = &quot;Goacna 2€an +216</p><p>where 7,, is the next-nearest-neighbor bond energy.</p><p>The L2, phase is also known as the Heusler phase with the ideal composition A,BC and can appear only in ternary systems; the lattice is shown in Fig. 5.22. It has the same arrangement of sites as D0,, but two sublattices have the same element (A) while the other two have different elements (B and C).</p><p>Partitioning of the Gibbs energy for phases that never undergo disordering</p><p>Phases with many sublattices may become very complicated in multicomponent systems since the number of “end members” is the product of the number of con: each sublattice. Many of these “end members” may represent compositions inside the single-phase region or far outside the phase’s stability region, thus it can be impossible to assess or evaluate any parameter value for these. The technique of setting the parameters equal to the mean value of the Gibbs energies of formation of each constituent, like in Eq. (5.39), is one possible way to handle this.</p><p>Another recent model involves partitioning the Gibbs energy into a substitutional and a sublattice description also for phases with sublattices that never disorder. For such a case there is no need to make the ordered contribution equal to zero and for those phases</p><p>tuents in</p><p>one simply has</p><p>Gy = G(x) —T™ Sh + AGE (5.161)</p><p>AGO) = GO) (6.162)</p><p>G4 is described with a substitutional model and Ge&quot; includes the sublattices according to the crystalline structure. In Eq. (5.161) the ideal configurational entropy “&#39;S¢s is subtracted from the disordered part and the configurational entropy is calculated for the ordered part only.</p><p>The physical reason for adding a disordered contribution to a phase like o is that the interaction energies need not depend strongly on the sublattices where the constituents  =========== 146</p><p>5.8.6</p><p>5.9</p><p>5.9.1</p><p>Models for the Gibbs energy</p><p>are located. In particular, for a phase with a narrow composition range the disordered contribution makes it possible to have a smoother enthalpy curve far away from the composition range of stability and avoid unphysical curvatures. It also seems possible to model phases with small composition ranges with fewer parameters, using disordered interaction parameters.</p><p>This partitioning for phases that are always ordered is a very new model and little practical experience has been obtained. For the Laves phase the usual model has all constituents on all sublattices, but the o phase is normally modeled with a restricted set of constituents on the sublattices. With a disordered part it may be advantageous if all constituents were allowed to enter all sublattices. In the first case one would use for Fe—Cr</p><p>(Fe) 1o(Cr)a(Cr, Fe) ie (5.163)</p><p>and in the second case (Cr, Fe) 1o(Cr, Fe)4(Cr, Fe) ig (5.164)</p><p>An advantage of the second method would be that one could assign a value just to the °Gf, representing pure o Fe and would not have to bother about multicomponent parameters like °Gf...4,.4; that cannot be determined from experimental data.

This partitioning is used in the case study of the Re—W system in section 9.3.</p><p>Partitioning of parameters in physical models</p><p>Physical properties that are modeled separately, such as magnetism, may also have their parameters partitioned between the ordered and the disordered part. The individual parameters such as the Curie temperature from both parts will be added together before they are used to calculate contributions to the Gibbs energy of the phase.

The already-mentioned associated model is particularly useful for the liquid phase when different atoms like to be close to each other but still do not form stable molecules. Since the associated solution still uses the ideal configurational entropy, several attempts have been made to improve the agreement with experimental data by taking into account a quasi-chemical entropy expression. Two such models will be described here because they can be used in the PARROT program.</p><p>The modified quasi-chemical model</p><p>Various modifications of the quasi-chemical model have been used with considerable success by the FACT (Bale er al. 2002) group in Montreal to describe oxide and sulfide liquids. In their assessments they have not used the same model for the metallic liquid, which makes it impossible to describe some systems like Fe—-S and Zr—O for which there is no miscibility gap between the metallic and ionic liquids.</p><p>This model has been modified several times and it has not been used for any assess- ments with the software described in this book, so it will not be discussed further.

The cell model</p><p>A binary cell model was proposed by Kapoor et al. (1974) and later extended to multi- component systems by Guye and Welfringer (1984). It was first used for liquid oxide slags, but has recently been extended to sulfides and fluorides also.</p><p>The cell model has a special form of the quasi-chemical entropy. One considers cells with one anion and two cations. Originally only oxygen was considered, so the presentation here will be limited to oxides. The cells can have two identical or two different cations. The cells can be treated like constituents, but one has to be careful about the numbers of atoms in the constituents. The general rule is that the same number of anions must be provided from both cations in the constituent with two different cations. The mole fractions of the “component oxides,” i-e., the cells with only one type of cation, are, for n cations,</p><p>it Digi My (5.170) Q 0=5(»+Evai) (5.171) ial iv</p><p>where v; is the oxygen stoichiometry in the component oxide of the cation M, M,,0, As an example one may use the CaO-SiO, system, for which the constituents would be (CaO, SiO,, (CaO),SiO,) and the quantities above would be</p><p>Youo + 2Vca,Siog</p><p>Xexo = o Ysio, + sion = 9 2 = Yeao + Ysio: + 3Yearsiog (5.172)</p><p>The Gibbs energies of formation of the “component oxides” as well as the cell with two different cations are simply introduced into the “&#39;G,, part of Eq. (5.1) multiplied by their constituent fractions as in the ideal-solution model, Eq. (5.42). One has to be careful that the parameters are given the right values considering the number of atoms in the constituent; the parameters for formation of a cell are for one oxygen atom whereas the constituents defined here will be for v; +v; oxygen atoms.</p><p>The model then introduces a sum over the component oxides, D, defined as</p><p>D, =&gt; v)x; (5.173) i=</p><p>The important property of this sum is that the “component oxides” must be ordered in decreasing valency according to the cations. By introducing D, the model attempts to account for the charged behavior of the cells. The expression for the configurational entropy below, Eq.

It is interesting to note that the sublattice model developed by Hillert and Staffanson (1970) for solid phases was based on a model suggested by Temkin (1945) to take into account the configurational entropy in molten salts. In a liquid there is no LRO and one cannot distinguish sites for anions or cations, but the mathematical formalism using mixing on two different sites gives good agreement with experimental information. This means that exchanges of a cation with an anion must not be counted in calculating the configurational entropy by use of Eq. (2.11). In particular, on mixing four salts, A.C,, A,D,, B.C,, and B,D,, one obtains a reciprocal system as shown in Fig. 5.26, with A and B in the first sublattice and C and D in the</p><p>second:</p><p>(A, BP) (Co, Do (5.175)</p><p>If all ions have the same valence then P = Q = a and the Gibbs-energy expres for this liquid is identical to that for a crystalline two-sublattice model.

This model is called the “partially ionic two-sublattice liquid model” (Hillert et al. 1985) and it uses constituent fractions as composition variables. In order to handle a liquid with only cations, i.e., a metallic liquid, hypothetical vacancies are introduced on the anion sublattice, whereas in order to extend the model to non-metallic systems one introduces neutral species on the anion sublattice. The model can be written as</p><p>(CE) pAL Va, Boo (5.178)</p><p>where each pair of parentheses surrounds a sublattice, while C represents cations, A and B neutral species.

The superscripts v; on cations and anions as well as 0 for the neutral species will be omitted unless needed for clarity. The numbers of sites on the sublattices, P and Q, vary with the composition in order to maintain electro-neutrality. The values of P and Q are calculated from the following equations:</p><p>P=Dviyq, + Ova (5.179) 7 O=L Ne,</p><p>where y, denotes the constituent fraction of constituent i.

This criticism misses the point, because Eq. (5.182) is the general multicomponent expression and this model is indeed identical to simpler models in many special cases. The great advantage with Eq. (5.182) is that it allows a continuous description of a liquid that changes in character with varying composition. Equation (5.182) has successfully been used to describe oxide liquids, silicates, and sulfides as well as SRO in liquids and also molten salts and ordinary metallic liquids.</p><p>Compatibility between different liquid models</p><p>It is instructive to show how to convert from some different models to the liquid two- sublattice model. A liquid with two metallic elements like Fe and Cr would normally be treated as a substitutional-solution model, (Fe, Cr). In the liquid two-sublattice model  =========== 154</p><p>5.9.5</p><p>5.9.6</p><p>Models for the Gibbs energy</p><p>the description would be (Fe**, Cr+) 9(Va)g (taking the dominant valency only). For solutions with only vacancies in the anion sublattice, P and Q are always equal. All parameters for interactions between cations evaluated for a substitutional model can thus be used directly in the liquid two-sublattice model.</p><p>A liquid solution of C in Fe may also be treated as a substitutional solution, at least at high concentrations of carbon. However, it would not be realistic to assume that carbon has a positive valency and in the liquid two-sublattice formalism one would like to model it like (Fe**)p(Va, C)g. It is quite remarkable that this is also mathematically identical to a substitutional solution (Fe, C).</p><p>Another remarkable feature of Eq. (5.182) is that it becomes identical to the associate model for some simple binary systems, for example the Cu-S system modeled with an associate Cu,S. The associate model uses a substitutional solution of (Cu, S, Cu,S) whereas the liquid two-sublattice model uses (Cu&#39;*),(S?-, Va, S)g, but it is possible to identify the parameters in these two models with each other and they give identical results in both models. The assumptions behind the associate model and the liquid two-sublattice model are very different and it is interesting that these different assumptions can lead to the same mathematical expression. This shows clearly that one cannot make any statement about the true nature of a system just because a mathematical formalism based on some physical model of the system gives a good result. It may be possible that another physical model of the system will yield exactly the same mathematical formalism.</p><p>The aqueous solution</p><p>Model parameters for aqueous solutions are usually not stored in general databases but are often re-evaluated from various models for each particular application.

This technique has the same limitation as that of using chemical reactions for other equilibria as mentioned above.</p><p>For example, the reaction of a gas containing oxygen with bunsenite (NiO) to form a vacant site for Ni and two holes (denoted h*) in the conduction band to compensate for the electrons taken up forming the oxygen ion can be written as a chemical reaction using the Kréger and Vink notation:</p><p>0.508&quot; = Vi, +2h* +05, (5.191)</p><p>In standard textbooks such as Birks et al. (2006) it is shown that the fraction of vacancies in the Ni sublattice formed in this reaction depends on the partial pressure of oxygen as Pos This relation is obtained by using the “law of mass action” on the reaction above and replacing the fraction of holes by the fraction of vacancies on the Ni** sublattice from the electro-neutrality condition.</p><p>In Chen et al. (1998) the modeling of semiconductors is discussed and, to formulate a physically realistic model for the reaction above, it is reasonable to assume, as shown by Grundy (2006), that each hole is associated with an Ni?* ion to form an Ni** ion and the model should be</p><p>(Ni?*, Ni**, Va), (07), (5.192)</p><p>This model is identical to that used for wustite described in section 6.2.5.8 later.

It can nonetheless be illuminating to transfer a reaction notation to a CEF-type model in order to understand how realistic it is.</p><p>Final remarks</p><p>In most models the excess Gibbs energy includes contributions from all kinds of phys- ical phenomena, for example vibrational, electronic, and configurational, which are not described separately in a magnetic model, for example. It is not practical to use very detailed models for a particular contribution, for example configurational entropy, if other phenomena with equal or larger contributions to the Gibbs energy are described with a simpler excess model.</p><p>A note about model names may also be appropriate. For example, the special case of the CEF applied to chemical ordering is called the Bragg—Williams—Gorsky (BWG) model above when no excess terms are included, but some authors may call all models  =========== 158</p><p>5.11.1</p><p>Models for the Gibbs energy</p><p>Table 5.1 A tentative classification of the different models.

A possible classification of the different models, following Sundman (1990), is shown in Table 5.1. Of course, all models are special cases of the Ising model (Ising 1925).</p><p>Adjustable parameters in the models</p><p>The models and formalisms described in this chapter usually contain many more adjustable parameters than can be fitted with the available experimental values. This problem will be discussed several times in chapter 6. It is important to understand that the most critical parameters to be optimized are not those in the excess model, but those in the surface of reference part, “&#39;G,,. When a phase is modeled with associates or with sublattices there are parameters, such as °G¥texsn or °GRixe, in the surface of reference energy that must be fitted to experimental information. Since these parameters are multiplied by the lowest power of the fractions, they will have a larger influence on the behavior of the Gibbs energy than will any excess parameter. All parameters in ‘&quot;G,, must be referred to the reference state of the elements, but, if they describe compounds inside the composition range of the phase, the Kopp—Neumann rule, see section 5.2.3, is often used in addition to an adjustable enthalpy and entropy term. One must never set an end-member parameter equal to zero.</p><p>In fitting a thermodynamic model to experimental values, the final value of each adjustable coefficient depends on many of the different measurements and each measured value contributes to many of the coefficients. The advantage of the least-squares method is that these influences do not need to be known quantitatively, since the strategy of the method itself is to select the best possible agreement among all the coefficients and all the experimental values. Many of the parameters and coefficients of the models, however, are not able to improve the fit between descriptions and measurements significantly. Using  =========== 5.11.2</p><p>5.11.3</p><p>5.11 Final remarks 159</p><p>them in an excessive manner may lead the calculation to follow just the scatter of the experimental values, creating maxima and minima where a smooth line is physically more probable.</p><p>To judge whether a certain coefficient is well defined by the available set of measured values, the effect of each coefficient on the shape of calculated curves should be known at least qualitatively. It must be determined for each coefficient whether its influence on the shape of calculated functions really is necessary to improve the fit between calculation results and the experimental dataset. In the case studies in chapter 9 this check is described. If it is difficult to find enough arguments in a given case, the least-squares method should be applied twice, with and without the coefficient. Comparing the two results makes a decision possible in most cases. It is better to start a calculation with fewer coefficients than with some unnecessary ones. A systematic misfit between some series of experimental points and the corresponding calculated curve usually giv hints regarding what parameter or coefficient should be added.</p><p>es some</p><p>Models, formalisms, and curve-fitting formulae</p><p>In real phases a lot of features of the models described in this chapter may be more or less redundant. Then the “general model” becomes a “formalism,” which is used to describe the Gibbs energy of the phase by application of a “particular model.”</p><p>Using a formalism like the CEF, one may have many more parameters than necessary to fit the available data. One may then be forced to use some parameters purely for “curve fitting” of the experimental data, since it is not possible to relate their values to measured quantities.</p><p>Curve fitting normally means that a set of data is fitted to a mathematical function, ignoring any underlying physical or chemical relations. This can be the case also for thermodynamic modeling when just a single property is fitted. For example, if a phase diagram is fitted without using any thermochemical information, it is most unlikely that the enthalpies and entropies obtained from such an assessment will be realistic. It is mandatory to use all possible thermochemical information, even estimated values, to obtain realistic values also of the separate thermodynamic properties of a system, i.e., for the enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity. In addition, one must take care that the model parameters for a phase do not predict unrealistic values outside the range of stability of the phase. However, the question of what is unrealistic is sometimes debatable.</p><p>The lack of data is usually the main reason for using “curve fitting,” since it might not be possible to relate the model parameters to more than a single measured quantity.</p><p>Limitations in the models</p><p>Almost all models in commercial thermodynamic databases available today use the ideal (point) configurational entropy. This is sometimes a severe limitation since the SRO must then be modeled as an excess contribution. This excess contribution may give a bad extrapolation to higher-order systems, but the effort needed to change to the use of quasi- chemical or CVM-based models is considerable because the number of clusters increases  =========== 160</p><p>Models for the Gibbs energy</p><p>exponentially with the number of components. Another problem with these models is that one cannot just put a number of assessed systems together and extrapolate to a higher-order system. One must add the necessary pairs or clusters for all combinations of elements and calculate or estimate energies for these. Methods intended to simplify the CVM by using fewer clusters, like the CSA (Oates and Wenzl 1996), may resolve some of these problems, but any general change of model requires that all systems in the databases today be reassessed. Thus one should be careful in selecting any new model to be of general use.</p><p>Many simplifications in the modeling of the crystal structure may be necessary in order to limit the model parameters, in particular when there is little or no experimental information about the occupancies of the constituents in the sublattices. Even with very good information about this, one must have a lot of thermodynamic information, either experimental or from ab initio calculations.</p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="catppuccin-latte">catppuccin-latte</option><option value="catppuccin-frappe">catppuccin-frappe</option><option value="catppuccin-macchiato">catppuccin-macchiato</option><option value="catppuccin-mocha">catppuccin-mocha</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.8.0 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Saturday 14 December 2024 12:08">Saturday 14 December 2024</span>.
