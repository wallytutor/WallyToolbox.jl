materials behaviour even in situations where true equilibrium is never reached. Knowledge of critical temperatures, pressure and composition ranges for the formation of phases is very important in defining limiting parameters for usage or processing. However, certain processes develop microstructures which are well away from the equilibrium state, for example rapid solidification, mechanical alloying, vapour deposition, etc., and these cannot be directly interpreted using equilibrium phase diagrams. Phase equilibria are also not directly applicable to predicting the development of microstructure and, in this case, some further knowledge and application of phase transformation theory is necessary.</p><p>These limitations to a ‘traditional’ CALPHAD approach have long been under- stood and the combination of thermodynamics and kinetics is seen as a logical extension of the CALPHAD methodology. While phase transformation theory is often seen as a somewhat separate area, certain critical input parameters can only be obtained from the understanding of phase equilibria. For example, the simplest case of transformation in steels requires, at the very least, knowledge of the temperature below which austenite becomes unstable to the precipitation of ferrite (T7~?). If one wishes to use some form of growth equation, the driving force for the growth of ferrite in austenite is required. This driving force is often approximated as some function of the undercooling below T7~® and hidden within a series of adjustable parameters which take into account other effects. It is, therefore, not always explicitly recognised as a thermodynamic input parameter.</p><p>The aim of this chapter is to introduce the reader to some of the ways in which the CALPHAD approach has been combined with kinetics to predict the formation of phases and/or microstructures under conditions which are not considered to be in equilibrium. Broadly speaking, the combination of thermodynamics and kinetics can be broken down into at least two separate approaches: (1) the calculation of metastable equilibria and (2) the direct coupling of thermodynamic and kinetic modelling.</p><p>In its simplest form, the calculation of metastable equilibria merely requires the ‘suspension’ of an equilibrium phase, for example, the calculation of the Fe-C</p><p>41  =========== 412 N. Saunders and A. P. Miodownik</p><p>phase diagram with or without graphite to give respectively the Fe + graphite phase diagram or the Fe-Fe3C phase diagram. This is often done empirically; for example the Fe-graphite phase diagram is used for cast irons while the Fe-Fe;C diagram is used for steels. Rapid solidification processing is another area where kinetic limitations are often arbitrarily placed on the system in order to use conventional G/z diagrams as a tool to help interpret phase formation.</p><p>Such an approach should not be confused with the direct coupling of thermo- dynamic and kinetic parameters. Broadly speaking, this can achieved either</p><ol><li>By the direct coupling of thermodynamic and kinetic models in a single</li></ol><p>software package, where the kinetic model can call the thermodynamic calculation part as a subroutine for the calculation of critical input parameters.</p><p>or</p><ol><li>Thermodynamic calculations are made separately and calculated data are</li></ol><p>input into a kinetic model, perhaps from a datafile.</p><p>Direct coupling has a number of significant advantages as ‘local’ effects can be directly calculated rather than globally approximated under a single external input. The present chapter will present detailed examples of the above approaches and discuss their advantages/disadvantages and areas of applicability.</p><p>11.2. THE CALCULATION OF METASTABLE EQUILIBRIA</p><p>11.2.1 General concepts and sample calculations</p><p>An advantage of the CALPHAD method over experimental measurement of phase diagrams is that it is possible to make predictions for the extension of various phase fields outside their range of equilibrium stability. For example, Ansara (1979) was able to straightforwardly show the variety of metastable phase diagrams that could exist for a system such as Ni-Ti (Fig. 11.1). Some of the diagrams are for regions which would be highly metastable and, therefore, unlikely to be accessible, but the figure clearly shows how a phase diagram could be modified if suppression of various phases were to occur.</p><p>Figure 11.2 shows the calculated stable phase diagram for Fe-C from Gustafson (1985) which is characterised by a eutectic between 7-Fe and graphite. This eutectic occurs for many cast irons and graphite forms from the liquid state. However, if the C level is low, as in steels, solidification can occur directly to 6- or y-Fe. On cooling, the steel becomes unstable to the formation of graphite and there is a driving force for its precipitation. However, the volume change on forming graphite from the solid state is high and the nucleation of graphite becomes difficult. A variety of conditions then lead to the formation of the metastable phase Fe;C which has transus temperatures only marginally below those found for equilibrium with graphite. It is difficult to overemphasise the importance of this effect as many</p><p>References are listed on pp. 458-461.  =========== CALPHAD—A Comprehensive Guide</p><p>2000</p><p>TEMPERATURE, K S 3 3S</p><p>Ni calculated TiNi observed Ti</p><p>Figure 11.1.

It is only because the kinetics of transformation to graphite is so slow that the breakdown of the desirable carbide structure to a much weaker graphite-containing alloy is prevented. This effect has been known empirically for many years and CALPHAD calculations can be made for the metastable Fe-Fe3C phase diagram (Fig. 11.3). This is done by ‘suspending’ graphite from the calculations but otherwise keeping the same model parameters for the liquid, f.c.c. and b.c.c. phases.</p><p>Another such example occurs in Ti-Si alloys. The stable phase diagram of Ti-Si indicates that, below 1170°C, G- and a-Ti become unstable with respect to Ti3Si. However, in practice, Ti3Si only forms after lengthy anneals at high temperature and TisSi3 is formed instead. Calculations for commercial Ti-alloys (Saunders 1996a) are then routinely made considering only TisSi; and its phase boundaries are extrapolated by the calculation below 1170°C.</p><p>Another use of metastable diagrams is in the processing of some Nimonic super- alloys which are unstable to 7 phase formation (Betteridge and Heslop 1974). Usually, alloys of this type rely on the precipitation-hardening of -y, the Ni-based matrix phase, by +y, an ordered intermetallic based on Ni3Al. However, when the ratio of Ti/Al becomes too high, a 7-phase based on Ni3Ti can form as well. As the kinetics of +’ precipitation is faster than 7, most processing can be done so that 7 forms instead, and at some service temperatures transformation kinetics may be sluggish enough so that the metastable +’ does not then transform to 7. It is therefore of value to be able to predict both the stable and metastable solvus temperatures for 7 and +y’ and understand the behaviour of the alloy with either both phases appearing or with only 7’ taking part. A Nimonic 263 alloy with a composition (in wt%) Ni-0.5Al-20Co—20Cr-5.9Mo-2. 1 Ti-0.001B-0.06C can be used as an example. Figures 11.4 and 11.5 show phase % plots for this alloy with 7 respectively included and excluded. It is interesting to note that the 7’ is only just metastable and its amount when 7 is excluded is similar to the amount of equilibrium 7 itself.</p><p>While the approach outlined above has proved useful in predicting phase equilibria for metastable alloys, it is rather limited as it does not allow any predictions to be made for the conditions under which metastability can be achieved. This means that the use of the CALPHAD route has to be tempered by the user’s judgement and past experience. Any quantification is not straightforward when phase competition is close, for example, in the case of some cast irons where the Fe3C and graphite phase boundaries are very similar. In this case some cooling conditions give rise to graphite while others give rise to Fe;C. However, when processing conditions are far from equilibrium it is possible to be more certain about the conditions where metastable equilibria are likely to be observed. An example of such an area is rapid- solidification processing.  =========== 416 N. Saunders and A. P.

They utilised the Tp criterion to predict the limit to the glass-forming range (GFR) of a number of binary and ternary systems. The Tp criterion follows the premise that, if cooling conditions</p><p>References are listed on pp. 458-461.  =========== CALPHAD—A Comprehensive Guide 417</p><p>G (kJ/mol)</p><p>“0</p><p>empd « | To limited | 1 Himited</p><p>o 123 6 5 6 7 8 9 wo MOLE FRACTION Ti x10</p><p>Figure 11.6, Calculated G/z curves for Ni-Ti at T, (760 K).

It is straightforward to find this limit by calculating the G/z diagram for the system of interest at Ty.</p><p>CALPHAD calculations were made for a number of binary systems including Au-Si, (Hf,Ti,Zr)—Be and Ni-Ti (Saunders and Miodownik 1983) and a series of ternaries Hf-Ti-Be, Hf-Zr—Be and Hf-Ti-Be (Saunders et al. 1985). Figure 11.6 shows such a calculation for Ni-Ti. The results were encouraging in that they pre- dicted with reasonable accuracy the limit to glass formation when the terminal solid solutions were considered. However, there was limited success when taking into account compound phases. To this end the approach was extended to include the kinetics of transformation more explicitly. Remarkably good results were then obtained for a wide variety of binary and ternary system and these are reported in Section 11.3.4,</p><p>11.2.3 Solid-state amorphisation The use of G/z diagrams has found more extensive use in the prediction of GFA by solid-state amorphisation reaction (SSAR) (Johnson 1986, Schwarz 1988). SSAR  =========== 418 N. Saunders and A. P. Miodownik</p><p>GIBBS FREE ENERGY (kCa¥/g-atom)</p><p>® 02 oe 08 on 10. A x= La</p><p>Figure 11.7. G/z curves for Au-La (from Schwarz and Johnson 1983). Open circles indicate fully amorphous structure, partly filled circles indicate partly amorphous structure.</p><p>can be achieved in a number of ways, for example by isothermal inter-diffusion reactions between thin films of elements (Schwarz and Johnson 1983) and mechanical alloying of elemental powders (Koch et al. 1983). The process relies on the fast diffusion of one of the elements into the other and the kinetics being sufficiently slow to prevent the formation of the intermetallic compounds. The thermodynamic stability of the amorphous phase is then the controlling factor in whether or not an alloy will form a glass.</p><p>The early work of Schwarz and Johnson (1983) used a prediction of the under- lying thermodynamics of the Au-La system to explain the relative stability of the liquid/amorphous phase in their elemental layered composites (Fig. 11.7). How- ever, they utilised the method proposed by Miedema (1976) for thermodynamic stability of the liquid/amorphous phase. There are clear limitations to the Miedema approach; firstly it is not guaranteed to produce the correct phase diagram and therefore phase competition is at best only approximated, and secondly, the thermo- dynamics of the terminal solid solutions are chosen quite arbitrarily.</p><p>There are a number of studies where the CALPHAD approach to GFA in amor- phous systems has been used. Bormann and co-workers (1988, 1990, 1993) and Saunders and Miodownik (1986) have all used G/z diagrams to help explain the formation of amorphous phases in SSAR. This work has shown that as well as</p><p>References are listed on pp. 458-461.  =========== CALPHAD—A Comprehensive Guide 419</p><p>predicting the phase diagram, it is possible to demonstrate on a more quantitative basis the relative underlying stability of the various phases. While Saunders and Miodownik (1986) extrapolated the properties of the high-temperature liquid to the SSAR temperature, Bormann et al. (1988, 1990) considered the possibility of further stabilisation due to the liquid-to-glass transition and this has significant advantages in helping to understand the thermodynamic properties of the amorphous state. The use of the CALPHAD route also pointed to a potential reaction sequence that could explain the initial stages of the amorphisation reaction (Saunders and Miodownik 1986). It is clear from the G/s diagrams of a number of systems that a preceding step in the formation of an amorphous phase could be the supersaturation of an element such as Zr by fast-moving atoms such as Co and Ni (Fig. 11.8). This would then lead to a collapse of the crystalline structure to a more stable amorphous phase beyond a critical Co or Ni concentration. Some findings of the supersaturation of Zr by Co in layered structures have been reported (Samwer et al. 1988, Pampus ef al. 1987), which would be consistent with the proposed mechanism, and this was again suggested by Gfeller et al. (1988). However, it seems that the main mechanism for formation of the amorphous phase is by reaction at the interface (Johnson 1986). A further method of producing amorphous phases is by a strain-driven solid-state reaction (Blatter and von Allmen 1985, 1988, Blatter et al. 1987, Gfeller et al. 1988). It appears that solid solutions of some transition metal-(Ti,Nb) binary systems, which are only stable at high temperatures, can be made amorphous. This is done by first quenching an alloy to retain the high-temperature solid solution. The alloy is then annealed at low temperatures where the amorphous phase appears transiently during the decomposition of the metastable crystalline phase. The effect was explained by the stabilisation of the liquid phase due to the liquid—glass</p><p>30</p><p>Co-Zr</p><ul><li>= equilibrium compound</li></ul><p>G (kJ/mol)</p><ul><li><p>LiguID</p></li><li><ul><li></li></ul></li></ul><p>0 10 20 30 40 0 60 70 80 % 100 At% Zr</p><p>Figure 11.8.

A more innovative approach was taken by Saunders (1984) and Saunders and Miodownik (1985, 1987) for the prediction of phases formed by vapour co-deposition of alloys. It was postulated that the formation of phases on the substrate is controlled by the diffusional breakdown of fully intermixed depositing atoms so that three kinetic regimes are observed:</p><p>(i) At low substrate temperatures the surface mobility is insufficient for the nec- essary diffusional movement to transform to multi-phase mixtures. The final structure of the deposited film is, therefore, constrained to be single phase.</p><p>(ii) With increasing substrate temperature the decomposition to non-equilibrium multi-phase mixtures is observed.</p><p>(iii) When the substrate temperature is high enough, the atomic mobility at the surface is sufficient to allow the necessary atomic re-arrangements for the formation of equilibrium phases.</p><p>References are listed on pp. 458-461.  =========== CALPHAD~A Comprehensive Guide 421</p><p>By using a simple kinetic model it was possible to predict the distance an atom could move on the surface, d, and show that, when d&lt;5 nm, a co-deposited alloy would be constrained to be single-phase. It was further hypothesised that, as depositing atoms lose their kinetic energy within a few atomic vibrations, any transformation in- volving an intermediate high-temperature phase, whether liquid or solid, was unlikely. As nucleation and growth processes are controlled by the substrate temp- erature, the phase formed in the first kinetic regime should be the most thermo- dynamically stable phase at the temperature of the substrate.

THE DIRECT COUPLING OF THERMODYNAMICS AND KINETICS</p><p>Historically, the main area of this type of modelling has been in steels and for con- structing transformation diagrams (Kirkaldy et al. 1978, Bhadeshia 1982, Kirkaldy and Venugopolan 1983, Enomoto 1992, Lee and Bhadeshia 1992). The models have considered simple formalisms for describing the Gibbs energy of the solution phases (Kirkaldy and Baganis 1978, Hasiguchi et al. 1984, Enomoto and Aaronson 1985, Sugden and Bhadeshia 1989) which have usually been austenite and ferrite, and in the dilute solution range. The models have been shown to work well and have been extensively used for low to medium alloyed steels. However, although quite complex carbides can be included within the formalisms (Kroupa and Kirkaldy</p><ol><li>they are generally limited in their application to only small additions of</li></ol><p>substitutional elements.</p><p>The use of more generally applicable concentrated solution models has, until recently, been somewhat neglected. This has been mainly due to the increase in computational time which is necessary to calculate equilibria with the more complex models and, to a somewhat lesser extent, the lack of good assessments using more generally applicable concentrated solution models. In recent years the Thermo-Calc software programme (Sundman 1991) has been used to calculate the necessary thermodynamic input for kinetic modelling and included in the DICTRA software programme for simulation of diffusional reactions in multi-component</p><p>References are listed on pp. 458-461.  =========== CALPHAD—A Comprehensive Guide 423</p><p>alloys (Agren 1992). This has led to a series of publications for a variety of material types (Liu 1994, Engstrém et al. 1994, Du and Agren 1994) and has demonstrated the advantage of producing a more generalised approach to phase transformations.</p><p>The direct coupling of thermodynamics and kinetics for predicting phase for- mation in rapidly solidified (RS) alloys has proved a fruitful area of research. The use of explicitly derived thermodynamic input parameters in standard kinetic formalisms has shown that the entropy of fusion is one of the controlling features in the liquid—solid transformation at these high cooling rates. This has led to excellent predictions for the glass-forming ability (GFA) in metallic alloys (Saunders and Miodownik 1986, 1988) and the prediction of solubility extension in RS Al-alloy alloys as a function of cooling rate (Saunders and Tsakiropoulos 1988, Pan et al. 1989, Saunders and Miodownik 1991). More complex work which considers diffusional effects during growth has been undertaken by Jonsson and Agren (1988) and Jénsson (1991).</p><p>At more conventional cooling rates the kinetic model proposed by Gulliver (1922) and developed further by Scheil (1942) has been used with excellent success for certain types of alloys. This formalism assumes that back diffusion in the solid during solidification can be considered small enough to be neglected and this process can be simulated by a simple modification of an equilibrium calculation. Predictions for such solidification in Al-alloys can almost completely match extensive and detailed experimental results (Backerud et al. 1990). Further, the use of calculated fraction solid vs temperature curves and associated heat evolution leads to superior simulations for the freezing behaviour of an LM25 alloy during sand-casting (Spittle et al. 1995).</p><p>More complex formalisms have been used with excellent success, particularly for steels where fast diffusion of C in the solid occurs. To account for this Yamada and Matsumiya (1992), Mettinen et al. (1992) and Matsumiya et al. (1993) have all included the effect of back diffusion in their modelling.</p><p>The next four sections will discuss some of the above work in detail. The first two sections concem solid state transformations with section (11.3.1) concentrating on steels while section (11.3.2) looks in more detail at the DICTRA programme. The last two sections concern liquid—solid transformations. Section (11.3.3) deals with conventional solidification while section (11.3.4) deals with rapid solidification.</p><p>11.3.1 Phase transformations in steels</p><p>This section will begin by looking at how thermodynamic and kinetic modelling has been combined to understand time-temperature-transformation diagrams in steels. The work, for the most part, is semi-empirical in nature, which is forced upon the topic area by difficulties associated with the diffusional transformations, particularly where nucleation aspects have to be considered. The approaches have considered how best to predict the time/temperature conditions for austenite to  =========== 424 N. Saunders and A. P.

Figure 11.13 shows a simple schematic isothermal transformation diagram for a low-alloy steel and is characterised by the appearance of two ‘noses’ and a bay. The ‘noses’, or ‘C’ curves, correspond to (1) the diffusional transformation of austenite to ferrite and/or pearlite and (2) displacive reactions concerned with the formation of Widmanstatten ferrite and/or bainite. The bay corresponds to an area where there is insufficient undercooling necessary to nucleate the displacive transformations while there is insufficient diffusive movements to allow ferrite or pearlite to form.</p><p>11.3.1.1 The prediction of transformation diagrams after Kirkaldy et al. (1978). A model for the calculation of ferrite and pearlite was first presented by Kirkaldy et al. (1978) based on Zener-Hillert type expressions (Zener 1946, Hillert 1957). In this first effort, no attempt was made to differentiate between the diffusive and displacive transformations and a overall ‘C’ curve was produced of the type shown schematically in Fig. 11.14. Kirkaldy et al. (1978) used the formalism below where the general formula for the time (7) to transform z fraction of austenite at a temp- erature T is given by</p><p>z 1 dz 8.0) = aaa aan | ag a re aa) where a = 82(-)/2, @ is an empirical coefficient, G is the ASTMS grain size, AT is the undercooling below the temperature where austenite is unstable with respect to ferrite (the Aes temperature) and q is an exponent dependent on the effective diffusion mechanism.</p><p>References are listed on pp. 458-461.  =========== CALPHAD—A Comprehensive Guide 425</p><p>Ferrite</p><p>Temp</p><p>Bainite</p><p>Time Figure 11.14, Schematic TTT diagram for a low-alloy steels showing ferrite and bainite formation with ‘overall’ C curve behaviour assumed by Kirkaldy ef al.

The limitations to dilute solution theory have been discussed earlier (Chapter 5) and mean that, at best, the total level of alloy addition cannot rise much beyond a few per cent. However, for the case of the hardenable steels of interest to Kirkaldy et al. (1978) this limitation does not present any real problems, as total levels of C do not tise above 0.7wt% and the total addition of the other alloying elements does not rise above 2.75wt%. Some comparisons between calculated and observed TTT diagrams are shown in Figs. 11.15((a)}(d)).</p><p>11.3.1.2 The prediction of transformation diagrams after Bhadeshia (1982). Later work by Bhadeshia (1982) noted that the approach of Kirkaldy et al. (1978) could not predict the appearance of the bay in the experimentally observed TTT diagrams of many steels, and he proposed that the onset of transformation was governed by nucleation. He considered that the time period before the onset of a detectable amount of isothermal transformation, +, could be reasonably defined as the incubation period, 7,, necessary to establish a steady-state nucleation rate. The following expression for 7, was then utilised</p><p>Ts XK</p><p>T (yD (11.5) where D is an effective diffusion coefficient relating to boundary or volume diffusion depending on the coherency state of the nucleus, G?, is the maximum volume free-energy change accompanying the formation of a nucleus in a large amount of matrix phase and p is an exponent dependent on the nature of the nucleus.

Enomoto (1992) has recently developed a model for predicting the growth of pro- eutectoid ferrite from austenite using an approach which considers the nucleation of ferrite in a fashion similar to that of Bhadeshia (1982). In addition, capillarity effects due to the volume change in transforming from austenite to ferrite are considered and the change between the condition of para-equilibrium and local equilibrium is taken into account. In the presence of capillarity the composition of the nucleus, x’, in the temary system Fe-M-C was obtained by solving the following equations:</p><p>Hie — He = Be = Bh = Be ~ BE Be (11.14) 7s Va ve . ‘e M Cc</p><p>Once the composition of the critical nucleus is found, the driving force for its formation can be obtained using the equation:</p><p>=k DWH (11.15) ras For the case of para-equilibrium, where M is a substitutional atom, 21’ is calculated from the equation</p><p>elt</p><p>Ve Vg Where py = (ttre — Om)/(1+0) and V, = (Vee + 6Vm)/(1 +6) are, respec- tively, the average chemical potential and partial molar volumes of Fe and M atoms and @ = {,/z$,, where xf, and xf, are the bulk concentrations of Fe and M.

Some assumptions were made concerning the growth mode and the calculation of this tie-line is dependent on whether growth occurred under the following alternative conditions:</p><p>(1) Local equilibrium, i.e., both the substitutional elements and carbon partition between austenite and ferrite. This was called the PLE mode and was taken to occur at high temperatures.</p><p>(2) Para-equilibrium, where only carbon partitions between austenite and ferrite and the concentration of the substitutional elements Fe and Mn does not vary.

In this case only carbon partitions between austenite and ferrite, but there is also a narrow diffusion spike of Fe and Mn at the vicinity of the inter- face. This was called the NPLE mode.</p><p>The calculation of the composition of austenite and ferrite at the interface is further modified by the diffusivity of the various elements and, using the above approach, Enomoto (1992) was able to calculate TTT diagrams for a number of Fe-Mn-C alloys and compare these with experiment (Figs. 11.19(a) and (b)). Results were reasonable and the effect of assumptions concerning planar and spherical growth on results were also discussed. More recently papers by Tanaka et al, (1995a-c), Bourne et al.

(1993) have sought to combine thermodynamics and kinetics in a similar fashion, mainly in the area of growth or dissolution of proeutectoid ferrite.</p><p>11.3.2 The DICTRA programme</p><p>Probably the most closely coupled thermodynamic and kinetic approach to phase transformations has been undertaken in the development of the DICTRA programme (Agren 1992). The philosophy has been to make a software programme which can access Thermo-Calc and utilise a full range of thermodynamic models. It is therefore more generalised and can be applied to a variety of material types. For example, it is possible to deal with such diverse problems as the dissolution of cementite in Fe-Cr—C alloys (Liu et al. 1991), the nitriding and nitrocarburizing of Fe (Du and Agren 1994), the carburizing of Ni-based alloys (Engstrém et al. 1994), the growth of o in Ni-based superalloys (Jénsson et al. 1993) and solidification (Agren 1995).</p><p>The DICTRA programme is based on a numerical solution of multi-component diffusion equations assuming that thermodynamic equilibrium is locally maintained at phase interfaces.

However, each tie-line may be specified uniquely by the chemical potential of one of the three components and thus there are only two unknowns and two equations to solve.

Using the same governing principles as described in the previous section, the DICTRA package is also able to simulate situations which, broadly speaking, lie in the realm of diffusion couples; for example, coatings on Ni-based alloys (Engstrém and Agren 1996, Engstrém et al. 1997), carburization (Engstrém et al. 1994) and nitriding (Du and Agren 1994).

themselves are designed to homogenise the ‘cored’ structure. Others are associated
with the formation of secondary phases which are detrimental to the mechanical
properties of the casting. Early classical treatments of non-equilibrium solidification
by Gulliver (1922), Scheil (1942) and Pfann (1952) have led to an equation for
predicting the amount of transformation in a binary alloy as a function of
temperature based on knowledge of the liquid/solid elemental partition coefficients.
It is instructive to briefly derive what has become known as the ‘Scheil equation’.

For solidification described by the lever rule and assuming linear liquidus and
solidus lines, the composition of the solid (C,) as a function of the fraction solid
transformed (f,) is given by the equation

~ fi(k—-1) +1

where k is the partition coefficient and is constant during solidification, and Co is
the composition of the original liquid alloy. This can be re-arranged to give

complementary limiting case to equilibrium solidification is to assume that solute
diffusion in the solid phase is small enough to be considered negligible, and that
diffusion in the liquid is extremely fast, fast enough to assume that diffusion is
complete. In this case Eq. (11.23) can be rewritten as

 

Cy = kOo(1— fa)&quot; (11.2)
and Eq. (11.24) as
-1-(%2T
fe=l # = nm): (11.26)

The treatment above is the traditional derivation of the Scheil equation. However, it
is not possible to derive this equation, using the same mathematical method, if the
partition coefficient, k, is dependent on temperature and/or composition. The Scheil
equation is applicable only to dendritic solidification and cannot, therefore, be applied
to eutectic-type alloys such Al-Si-based casting alloys, or even for alloys which may
be mainly dendritic in nature but contain some final eutectic product. Further, it
cannot be used to predict the formation of intermetallics during solidification.
Using a CALPHAD route all of the above disadvantages can be overcome. The
process that physically occurs during ‘Scheil’ solidification can be envisaged as
follows (Fig. 11.30). A liquid of composition Cp is cooled to a small amount below
its liquidus to 7;. It precipitates out solid with a composition C\]</p><p>and the liquid changes its composition to C/. However, on further cooling to T the initial solid cannot change its composition owing to lack of back-diffusion and it is effectively</p><p>%Solute —</p><p>Figure 11.30. Schematic representation of solidification occurring under ‘Scheil’ conditions.  =========== 444 N. Saunders and A. P. Miodownik</p><p>‘isolated’. A local equilibrium is then set up where the liquid of composition Cf transforms to a liquid of composition C# and a solid with composition C$ which is precipitated onto the original solid with composition C<span>$. This process occurs again on cooling to T; where the liquid of composition C} transforms to a liquid of com- position Cl, and a solid with composition C$</span> grows on the existing solid. This process occurs continuously during cooling and, when k &lt; 1, leads to the solid phase becoming lean in solute in the centre of the dendrite and the liquid becoming more and more enriched in solute as solidification proceeds. Eventually, the com- position of the liquid will reach the eutectic composition and final solidification will occur via this reaction.</p><p>Any appearance of secondary phases can be easily taken into account in this approach with the assumption that no back-diffusion is involved. Therefore all transformations can be handled, including the final eutectic solidification. This approach is based on a series of isothermal steps but, as the temperature step size becomes small, it provides results which are almost completely equivalent to those which would be obtained from continuous cooling.</p><p>The procedure described above is simple to model in a computer programme and has a number of significant advantages: (1) The ‘Scheil equation’ is only applicable to binary alloys and is not easily derived with multiple k values, which would be necessary for a multi-component alloy. A calculation as described above can be applied to an alloy with any number of elements. (2) The partition coefficients need not be constant, which is a prerequisite of the ‘Scheil equation’. (3) The ‘Scheil equation’ cannot take into account other phases which may form during such a solidification process. This is handled straightforwardly by the above calculation route.</p><p>11.3.3.1 Using the Scheil solidification model. Although it is realised that some back-diffusion will occur, results on the calculation of solidification using the Scheil simulation have proved to be successful in a number of cases. For Al-alloys it appears to be particularly successful, allowing not only very accurate predictions for fraction solid transformed (f,) as a function of temperature but also for predict- ing the phases which appear during solidification, which in Al-alloys, is a complex phenomenon.</p><p>Saunders (1997a) made extensive comparisons between predicted solidification behaviour and the experimental work of Backerud et al. (1986) who examined nearly 40 Al-alloys, encompassing all types ranging from the 1000 series through the various casting alloys to 7000 series alloys such as AA7075. Their work provides ‘fraction solid (f,)’ vs temperature curves for all alloys and detailed information on the phases formed during solidification. All of the alloys studied by Backerud et al. (1986) were modelled and results predicted for both fs vs temperature and phase formation.

Therefore the concentration of C in austenite at the liquid-solid interface remains fairly constant and little diffusion of C will actually occur. Some questions may still be raised about the degree to which Si diffuses, but predicted composition profiles in austenite appear consistent with those observed experimentally (Jolley and Gilbert 1987).</p><p>Figure 11.32 shows a f, vs temperature plot for a lamellar grey cast iron and compares this with that predicted for equilibrium solidification. While the behaviour in both cases is similar up to about 70-80% of the transformation, the two curves deviate sharply above this point as the liquid becomes increasingly enriched with elements such as P, Mo and Cr. Final solidification (f, &gt;0.97) involves both cementite and FesP, both of which can be observed in interdendritic regions of cast irons (Elliott 1988). Although the P level is only 0.05wt%, its formation is consistent with experimental observations of interdendritic phosphide (Janowak and Gundlack 1982). Figure 11.33 shows the solute profile in the liquid and the behaviour of all elements is consistent with experimental observation, particularly the sharp increase of Mo in the final interdendritic liquid. Both the Cr and Mn decrease at the very end of transformation which is associated with the formation of Fe3C in this last part of solidification.</p><p>Simulations for Ni-based superalloys have been carried out by Saunders (1995, 1996b), Chen et al.

The simulation predicted that the interdendritic regions would contain both y’ and Ni;Ti, and experimental results (Small 1993) indeed confirmed the presence of both phases, showing that the Scheil simulation was able to produce good results for liquid/solid partitioning.</p><p>Recent attempts at solidification modelling have been made for René N4 (Chen et al. 1994) and IN718 (Boettinger et al. 1995) using a database collected from early Kaufman work. The work on IN718 by Boettinger et al. (1995) is in reason- able agreement with the known behaviour of this alloy, and the form of their ‘Scheil’ plot is similar to that predicted by Saunders (1996b), who also included B and C in the calculation (Fig. 11.34). However, the results for René N4 suggested that a ‘Scheil’ simulation for this alloy produced a freezing range greater than observed in practice. To account for this apparent discrepancy a new type of solidification mechanism was proposed and a modified ‘Scheil’ plot was produced. However, it is noted that a straightforward ‘Scheil’ plot using a recently assessed Ni-database (Saunders 1996b) gives a similar freezing range to the modified plot of Chen et al. (1994). Clearly there is little need to resort to new, complex solidification mechanisms in this particular case.</p><p>11.3.3.2 Modifying the Scheil solidification model.

Their results produced good predictions for the formation of the secondary phases for both alloys and for f, of primary phase in one alloy (Al-Sat%Li—lat%Cu).

It is also possible to take into account the effects of back-diffusion by more explicitly solving the diffusion equations during the solidification process. This requires that the thermodynamic and kinetic parts of the transformation are solved simulta- neously. One of the strengths of the DICTRA programme is that, in addition to handling solid-state transformations, it can be applied to solidification. This has been done for stainless steels (DICTRA 1996) and Ni-based superalloys (Saunders 1997b).

While solidification at conventional cooling rates mainly concems itself with diffusion in the solid, and usually takes diffusion in the liquid to be complete, the time scales involved in rapid solidification are so small that diffusion in the solid state can effectively be ignored and the main questions concerning diffusivity lie within the liquid. Also, a number of phenomena such as glass formation and extension of solid solubility limits have been treated by modelling nucleation effects as well as those involving growth.</p><p>One of the earliest attempts to explicitly combine thermodynamics and kinetics in rapid solidification was by Saunders ef al.

(1985), however, were able to show that G* could vary markedly both between various alloy systems and between various competing phases in the same alloy system. This was first demon- strated in the Ti-Be system (Saunders et al. 1985) where the metastable compound, TiBe, controls the ability of Ti-Be alloys to form glasses. This was successfully modelled (Fig. 11.37(a) and (b)) and the method was further applied to the Au-Si and Ag~Si systems (Kambli et al. 1985) where GFA was also controlled by phases not observed in the stable phase diagram (Figs. 11.38 (a) and (b)).</p><p>temperature (°C)</p><p>200 0 10 20 30 40 So 60 70 80 90 100 Ti At% Be Be</p><p>temperature (°C)</p><p>log time (secs)</p><p>Figure 11.37.

A simple derivation of Eqs (11.29) and (11.30) shows that</p><p>Gs, wan * (11.35)</p><p>where AT, = (Tiiq—T), Tr = T&#39;/Tiiq and K&#39; is a geometric constant based on the shape of the nucleus. Therefore, phases which have a high entropy of fusion will be more difficult to form than those with low entropies of fusion. This can perhaps be best understood by the fact that the work needed to form the interface relates back to the entropy of fusion. As the entropy of fusion increases the work necessary to create the interface will become larger, hence the activation barrier to nucleation increases, The approach culminated in a paper where the glass-forming ability of nearly 20 binary and ternary systems was predicted with excellent results (Saunders and Miodownik 1988). Figure 11.39(a}(d) show results from some of the binary systems and Fig. 11.40 for the Ti-Zr-B ternary systems. A great strength of the combined thermodynamic and kinetic model is that once an alloy system has been thermodynamically characterised, the only additional input parameter for the software programme is the value of T;.</p><p>A nucleation approach was also applied to predicting the extension of solid solubility obtained in Al-alloys by rapid solidification. In this case the competition for forming either the supersaturated Al solid solution or the equilibrium compound was taken to be nucleation controlled (Saunders and Tsakiropoulos 1988). The model was first applied to high-pressure gas-atomised (HPGA) Al-Cr and Al-Zr alloys and was immediately able to predict a number of important general effects, all of which are consistent with experimental observation.</p><p>(1) The necessary undercooling for the formation of compounds is far larger than those for the supersaturated Al phase, undercooling being defined as (Tiiq — Terit,a), Where Terit,a is the critical nucleation temperature of the phase in question.</p><p>(2) The formation of supersaturated Al is favoured by decreasing powder size/ increasing cooling rate and the composition at which the intermetallic phases become rate limiting is shifted to higher concentrations of solute with decreasing powder size/increasing cooling rate.</p><p>(3) As had been found in the glass-forming systems, the predicted undercoolings for compounds could vary markedly both between various types alloy systems and between various competing phases in the same alloy system.</p><p>Predominant nucleation maps could then be constructed (Figs. 11.41(a) and (b)) which show how the Al solution phase is extended as a function of composition and powder size.

A nucleation expression similar to Eq. (11.33) was then used, taking into account more specifically the effects of heterogeneous nucleation. Growth was then modelled considering solute</p><p>References are listed on pp. 458-461.  =========== CALPHAD—A Comprehensive Guide 457</p><p>diffusivity in the liquid and ‘solute drag’ effects (Agren 1989), The solute-drag model considers the deviation from local equilibrium condition such that</p><p>G} = Gi + (AG; + AG, + Ani?) (11.36)</p><p>where G! and G} are the ordinary chemical potentials of component i in the liquid and solid next to the phase interface, AG; and AG, are the deviations from local equilibrium due to the finite interface kinetics and the Gibbs-Thompson effect respectively and Ay‘ is the deviation due to the solute drag effect of component i. AG; is given by</p><p>v AG; = —RTIn( 1-— 11.37, f n( 2) (11.37)</p><p>where v is the interface velocity, vp is a kinetic parameter of the order of the speed of sound and AG, is given by</p><p>1 1 AG, = o(&gt; +3) Vn (11.38)</p><p>where o is the surface tension and p; and pp are the principal radii of the interface curvature. To determine Ay‘ further limiting conditions have to be made, such as the assumption that growth is steady state and that there is proportionality between the diffusive flux at the liquid side of the interface and the difference in diffusion potential acting over the interface. The following equation can be derived for a binary system A-B (Agren 1989): -L</p><p>°= ope (Quit — Api) (11.39)</p><p>where x“/* and x*/ are the interfacial concentrations of B in the liquid and the solid phases respectively. L can be estimated from the equation</p><p>— Di (, _ t)\ b/s Lae (i z )z&#39; (11.40)</p><p>where Dj; is the trans-interphase diffusivity and 6 is the width of the interphase. There are further equations which interrelate the various parameters and these can then be used to define a system of non-linear equations which can be solved and allow the calculation of the crystal growth rate. From this it is possible to account for a transition between partitionless massive growth and partitioned growth, using a Cu-13%Ag alloy as an example.</p><p>The two growth regimes are associated with correspondingly distinct rates of latent heat evolution and, at some critical heat extraction rate, an interesting oscil- lation between the two growth types is predicted to occur. At sufficiently high  =========== 458 N. Saunders and A. P. Miodownik</p><p>undercoolings, i.e., at high heat extraction rates, nucleation occurs below the temperature where partitionless growth is favoured. Growth is then rapid, which gives rise to sufficient recalescence to bring its temperature back above the temperature where partitioned growth occurs. The rate of latent heat evolution then slows down and the heat extraction rate is sufficient so that the temperature begins to drop again and at some point falls below the critical temperature for partitionless transformation. The cycle can then begin again and a banded microstructure is predicted to occur. Such an effect was found to be consistent with microstructures observed experimentally by Boettinger ef al.
