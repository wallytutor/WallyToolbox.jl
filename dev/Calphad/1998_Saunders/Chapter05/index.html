Only rarely do calculations involve purely stoichiometric compounds. The calculation of a complex system which may have literally 100 different stoichio- metric substances usually has a phase such as the gas which is a mixture of many components, and in a complex metallic system with 10 or 11 alloying elements it is not unusual for all of the phases to involve solubility of the various elements. Solution phases will be defined here as any phase in which there is solubility of more than one component and within this chapter are broken down to four types: (1) random substitutional, (2) sublattice, (3) ionic and (4) aqueous. Others types of solution phase, such as exist in polymers or complex organic systems, can also be modelled, but these four represent the major types which are currently available in CALPHAD software programmes. For all solution phases the Gibbs energy is given by the general formula</p><p>G=G° + Gide! 4. Gr. (5.1)</p><p>where G° is the contribution of the pure components of the phase to the Gibbs energy, Gite! is the ideal mixing contribution and G%,, is the contribution due to non-ideal interactions between the components, also known as the Gibbs excess energy of mixing.</p><p>The random substitutional and sublattice models are intimately related, as a phase with random occupation of atoms on all sites can technically be considered as a phase containing a ‘single sublattice’ and mathematically the same general equations used in both cases. However, it is useful to separate the two types as the sublattice models implicitly define some internal, spatial substructure and give rise to site occupations which define stoichiometric compounds. Also, and very importantly, Gide! and G%*,, are governed by site occupation of the components in the various sublattices rather than the global concentration of the components themselves.</p><p>This chapter will begin, very briefly, with the thermodynamic representation of Gibbs energy for stoichiometric compounds before concentrating on the situation when mixing occurs in a phase.</p><p>5.2, STOICHIOMETRIC COMPOUNDS</p><p>The integral Gibbs energy, Giz, pj, of a pure species or stoichiometric compound is given simply by the equation</p><p>Ger, p) = Her,» — TSyr, (5.2)</p><p>where Hr, pj and Sir, p) are the enthalpy and entropy as a function of temperature and pressure. Thermodynamic information is usually held in databases using some polynomial function for the Gibbs energy which, for the case of the Scientific Group Thermodata Europe (Ansara and Sundman 1987), is of the form (Dinsdale</p><ol><li></li></ol><p>Grin — HSER = a + bT + cT n(T) +Lar. (5.3)</p><p>The left-hand-side of the equation is defined as the Gibbs energy relative to a standard element reference state (SER) where H5E® is the enthalpy of the element or substance in its defined reference state at 298.15 K, a, b, c and d, are coefficients and n represents a set of integers, typically taking the values of 2, 3 and -1. From Eq. (5.3), further thermodynamic properties can be obtained as discussed in Chapter 6.</p><p>= -b-c-eln(T)~ }ond,T™ H=a-cf-)-(n-1)d,T™ Cy = -c- So n(n-1)d,T™.</p><p>Equation (5.3) is given with respect to temperature but other terms associated with pressure and magnetism can be added. The representation of such effects is described more completely in Chapters 6 and 8.</p><p>5.3. RANDOM SUBSTITUTIONAL MODELS</p><p>Random substitutional models are used for phases such as the gas phase or simple metallic liquid and solid solutions where components can mix on any spatial posi- tion which is available to the phase. For example, in a simple body-centred cubic phase any of the components could occupy any of the atomic sites which define the cubic structure as shown below (Fig. 5.1).</p><p>In a gas or liquid phase the crystallographic structure is lost, but otherwise positional occupation of the various components relies on random substitution rather than any preferential occupation of site by any particular component.</p><p>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;figures/placeholder.png&quot; alt&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5.1. Simple body-centred cubic structure with random occupation of atoms on all sites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p><p>5.3.1 Simple mixtures</p><p>5.3.1.1 Dilute solutions. There are a number of areas in materials processing where low levels of alloying are important, for example in refining and some age- hardening processes. In such cases it is possible to deal with solution phases by dilute solution models (Wagner 1951, Lupis and Elliott 1966). These have the advantage that there is a substantial experimental literature which deals with the thermodynamics of impurity additions, particularly for established materials such as ferrous and copper-based alloys. However, because of their fundamental limi- tations in handling concentrated solutions they will only be discussed briefly.</p><p>In a highly dilute solution, the solute activity (a;) is found to closely match a linear function of its concentration (2;). In its simplest form the activity is written as</p><p>a; = 990; (6.4)</p><p>where +? is the value of the activity coefficient of i at infinite dilution. This is known as Henry’s law. Equation (5.5) may be rewritten in terms of partial free energies as</p><p>G, = G? + RT log, 2; (5.5)</p><p>where G?* has a constant value in the Henrian concentration range and is obtained directly from 7?. The expression can also be modified to take into account interactions between the solute elements and Eq. (5.5) becomes</p><p>Gi = GF + RT log, + RT) ela; (5.6)</p><p>where 2; is the concentration of solute i and e/ is an interaction parameter taking into account the effect of mixing of component i and j in the solvent. There are various other treatments of dilute solutions, mainly associated with how secondary interactions are considered (Foo and Lupis 1973, Kirkaldy et al. 1978, Bhadeshia 1981, Enomoto and Aaronson 1985). Recently a more sophisticated dilute solution treatment consistent with the Gibbs-Duhem integration in more concentrated solutions has been put forward by Bale and Pelton (1990). This allows the solute range handled by dilute solution models to be expanded significantly.</p><p>Unfortunately, the dilute solution model is limited in its applicability to concen- trated solutions. This causes problems for alloys such as Ni-based superalloys, high alloy steels, etc., and systems where elements partition strongly to the liquid and where solidification processes involve a high level of segregation. It is also not pos- sible to combine dilute solution databases which have been assessed for different solvents. The solution to this problem is to use models which are applicable over the whole concentration range, some of which are described below.</p><p>5.3.1.2 Ideal solutions. An ideal substitutional solution is characterised by the random distribution of components on a lattice with an interchange energy equal to zero. The entropy due to configuration is easily calculated and is related to the proability of interchange of the components. The configurational entropy S** is given by</p><p>sont — k log, We (5.7)</p><p>where k is Boltzmann’s constant and Wp is the number of configurations in which the components can be arranged for a given state. For a multicomponent system Wp is equal to the number of permutations given by</p><p>N! Wp = Tin! (5.8) where N= yn (5.9)</p><p>n, is the number of components of i and N is the total number of components in the system. For one mole of components, N is equal to Avogadro’s number. From Stirling’s formula, S°! is now equal to</p><p>cont slog, gon = trilogy: (5.10) The ideal molar entropy of mixing is then given by sides! — — Nk) x; log, a (8.11) i</p><p>where x; is the mole fraction of component i. With the assumption that the inter- change energy is zero it is possible to substitute the atoms without changing the energy of that state and Gide&quot;! is then given by</p><p>Gite! = -Tsidet! — RT 2; log, 2; (5.12) t</p><p>where R is the gas constant. The Gibbs energy of an ideal solution phase will then be</p><p>Gm = SiG? + RT Sx; log, 2; (5.13) a i</p><p>with G? defining the Gibbs energy of the phase containing the pure component 1. For the case of gases, ideal mixing is often assumed and this assumption can often be quite reasonable. However, in condensed phases there is always some interaction between components.</p><p>5.3.1.3 Non-ideal solutions: regular and non-regular solution models. The regular solution model is the simplest of the non-ideal models and basically considers that the magnitude and sign of interactions between the components in a phase are independent of composition. Assuming the total energy of the solution (Eo) arises from only nearest-neighbours bond energies in a system A — B then</p><p>Ey = waa Egg + wep Epp + wap Esp (5.14)</p><p>where waa, Wap, WB, Eva, Epp and Eg are the number of bonds and energies associated with the formation of different bond types AA, BB and AB. If there are N atoms in solution and the co-ordination number for nearest neighbours of the crystal structure is z, the number of bond types being formed in a random solution is</p><p>waa = 5Noa% (5.15a) wep = 5Neak (5.15b) wap = Nzzatp (5.15¢)</p><p>where x4 and xg are the mole fractions of A and B, Substituting Eqs (5.15 (a-c)) into Eq. (5.14) gives</p><p>N. Eo= &gt; (ta Eaa + 2p Epp + 24 2a(2E ap — Ena — Epp)). (5.16)</p><p>If the reference states are taken as pure A and B then Eq. (5.16) reverts to</p><p>N. Hnix = Sea 2p (2Eap — Esa — Epp) (5.17)</p><p>where Hmix is the enthalpy of mixing. If the bond energies are temperature dependent there will also be an excess entropy of mixing leading to the well-known regular solution model for the Gibbs excess energy of mixing</p><p>Gt, = arpQ (5.18)</p><p>where 2 is now a temperature-dependent interaction parameter. When generalised and added to Eq. (5.13) this gives</p><p>Gm = J) 2G? + RTS 2; log, 2; +S) Yo 24 5 Ny. (5.19) i i i p&gt; However, it has been realised for a long time that the assumption of composition- independent interactions was too simplistic. This led to the development of the sub- regular solution model, where interaction energies are considered to change linearly with composition. The following expression for G75, is then obtained as (Kaufman and Bernstein 1970)</p><p>GH, = 240; (Oia; + 04,25). (5.20)</p><p>Taking this process further, more complex composition dependencies to 2 can be considered and it is straightforward to show that a general formula in terms of a power series should provide the capability to account for most types of composition dependence (Tomiska 1980). The most common method is based on the Redlich— Kister equation and Eq. (5.19) is expanded to become</p><p>Gm = S02 GP + RES) xi log. 2; +S) 2125; (ai — 23)” (5.21)</p><p>where 8 is a binary interaction parameter dependent on the value of v. The above equation for Gz‘, becomes regular when v = 0 and sub-regular when v = 1. In practice the value for v does not usually rise above 2. If it is found necessary to do so, it is probable that an incorrect model has been chosen to represent the phase.</p><p>Equation (5.21) assumes ternary interactions are small in comparison to those which arise from the binary terms. This may not always be the case and where evidence for higher-order interactions is evident these can be taken into account by a further term of the type Gj, = 2; 2; 24 Lizz, where Ly, is an excess ternary interaction parameter. There is little evidence for the need for interaction terms of any higher order than this and prediction of the thermodynamic properties of substitutional solution phases in multi-component alloys is usually based on an assessment of binary and ternary terms. Various other polynomial expressions for the excess term have been considered, see for example the reviews by Ansara (1979) and Hillert (1980). All are, however, based on predicting the properties of the higher-order system from the properties of the lower-component systems.</p><p>Equation (5.21) is normally used in metallic systems for substitutional phases such as liquid, b.c.c., f.c.c., etc. It can also be used to a limited extent for ceramic systems and useful predictions can be found in the case of quasi-binary and quasi- ternary oxide systems (Kaufman and Nesor 1978). However, for phases such as interstitial solutions, ordered intermetallics, ceramic compounds, slags, ionic liquids and aqueous solutions, simple substitutional models are generally not adequate and more appropriate models will be discussed in Sections 5.4 and 5.5.</p><p>5.3.1.4 The extrapolation of the Gibbs excess energy to multi-component systems. As mentioned in the previous section, most methods of extrapolating the thermo- dynamic properties of alloys into multi-component systems are based on the summation of the binary and ternary excess parameters. The formulae for doing this are based on various geometrical weightings of the mole fractions (Hillert 1980). To demonstrate this principle, emphasis will be given to three of the main methods which have been proposed. For simplicity the binary systems will be represented as sub-regular solutions.</p><p>Muggianu’s equation The predominant method at the present time uses the equation developed by Muggianu et al. (1975). In this circumstance the excess energy in a multi- component system, as given by the last term of Eq. (5.21), expands for a sub- regular solution to Guz = tat B{ Lp + Lap (ta — 28)} + te tc{ Loc + Lyc(ta — 2c)}</p><ul><li>tatc{Li¢ + Lhc(ta - 2c)}- (5.22)</li></ul><p>Kohler’s equation In the Kohler equation (Kohler 1960) Gz, is described by</p><p>UNREADABLE (5.23)</p><p>Although different in form to the Muggianu equation, it becomes identical in a binary system as the various terms (z; + 2;) terms become equal to 1.</p><p>Toop’s equation</p><p>Both the Muggianu and Kohler equations can be considered symmetrical as they treat the components in the same way and do not differentiate between them. This is true for another method suggested by Colinet (1967) which is derived differently than either the Kohler or Muggianu equations but which can be reduced to the Muggianu equation (Hillert 1980). Toop’s equation (1965) is essentially different in that it considers one of the binary systems does not behave in the same way as the others and the extrapolation is based essentially on two of the binaries having identical mole-fraction products with the mole-fraction products of the third being different. For a sub-regular solution Toop’s equation breaks down to (Hillert 1980)</p><p>Gx = 2a TB{L 4p + Lyp(ta—2a—2c)} + tate {Lae + Lac(ta-2e—t2)}</p><p>B- IC Ly L —— : 5 +e ‘Bc + bo( 0 ato 1 2,,) (5.24)</p><p>Again this reduces to the normal sub-regular form in the binaries.</p><p>The geometrical representation of the Muggianu, Kohler and Toop equations is best summarised using the figures below.</p><p>In the Muggianu extrapolation it can be seen that the line from the ternary alloy composition to the edge binaries forms a right-angle to the binary. This has the consequence that, when the alloy composition is dilute in two of the components, the interaction parameter of these two components will approach regular behaviour because the term (x; — z;) becomes small. This is the case even if the ratio x; : 1; differs substantially from unity. This is not important for systems where the interaction terms higher than sub-regular are small in comparison to the regular term. However, for systems such as Cr-Ni where the sub-regular part predominates, any composition dependence of Cr-Ni interactions in dilute solutions with other elements will be ignored. This could have significant consequences in the prediction of activity coefficients in low-alloy steels for example. Kohler’s equation allows for the composition dependence of the binaries and in these circumstances</p><p>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;figures/placeholder.png&quot; alt&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5.2. Geometrical constructions of (a) Muggianu, (b) Kohler and (c) Toop models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p><p>may be preferable. In practice, the phase boundaries calculated by either the Muggianu and Kohler extrapolations seem to provide comparable results (Ansara et al. 1978), but it was noted that the choice of extrapolation method should receive more attention when exact knowledge of partial quantities such as activity coefficients is more critical. The Toop equation is not suitable for metallic systems but may be appropriate for some ionic liquid systems. However, it should be used with care in all cases as the extrapolation is dependent on which binary is chosen to behave differently, and it is possible to obtain three different answers depending on this choice.</p><p>5.4. SUBLATTICE MODELS</p><p>5.4.1 Introduction A sublattice phase can be envisaged as being composed of interlocking sublattices (Fig. 5.3) on which the various components can mix. It is usually crystalline in nature but the model can also be extended to consider ionic liquids where mixing on particular ‘ionic sublattices’ is considered. The model is phenomenological in nature and does not define any crystal structure within its general mathematical formulation. It is possible to define internal parameter relationships which reflect structure with respect to different crystal types, but such conditions must be externally formulated and imposed on the model. Equally special relationships apply if the model is to be used to simulate order—disorder transformations. Sublattice modelling is now one of the most predominant methods used to describe solution and compound phases. It is flexible and can account for a variety of different phase types ranging from interstitial phases such as austenite and ferrite in steels to intermetallic phases, such as sigma and Laves, which have wide homogeneity ranges. Furthermore, it can be extended to simulate Bragg— Williams—Gorsky ordering in metallic systems and be adapted to account for</p><p>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;figures/placeholder.png&quot; alt&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5.3, Simple body-centred cubic structure with preferential occupation of atoms in the body-centre and comer positions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p><p>ionic liquids. This section will begin by giving a detailed description of the multiple sublattice model of Sundman and Agren (1981) and give some specific examples of usage.</p><p>5.4.2 The generalised multiple sublattice model (Sundman and Agren 1981)</p><p>5.4.2.1 Definition of site fractions. The multiple sublattice model is an extension of earlier treatments of the two-sublattice models of Hillert and Steffansson (1970), Harvig (1971) and Hillert and Waldenstrom (1977). It allows for the use of many sublattices and concentration dependent interaction terms on these sublattices. To work with sublattice models it is first necessary to define what are known as site fractions, y{. These are basically the fractional site occupation of each of the components on the various sublattices where</p><p>at i = Ns nj is the number of atoms of component i on sublattice s and N’* is total number of</p><p>sites on the sublattice. This can be generalised to include vacancies, which are important to consider in interstitial phases, such that Eq. (5.25) becomes</p><p>(5.25)</p><p>y= mao (5.26)</p><p>and né,, is the number of vacancies on sublattice s.

The ideal entropy of mixing is made up of the configurational contributions by components mixing on each of the sublattices. The number of permutations which are possible, assuming ideal interchanges within each sublattice, is given by the following equation</p><p>We = [&gt;= (5.28)</p><p>and the molar Gibbs ideal mixing energy is</p><p>Gide! = Tide&quot; = RTS N* Sy! log. y! (5.29)</p><p>where y? includes contribution from vacancies.</p><p>5.4.2.3 Gibbs energy reference state. The Gibbs energy reference state is effectively defined by the ‘end members’ generated when only the pure components exist on the sublattice. Envisage a sublattice phase with the following formula (A, B),(C, D)). It is possible for four points of ‘complete occupation’ to exist where pure A exists on sublattice 1 and either pure B or C on sublattice 2 or conversely pure B exists on sublattice 1 with either pure B or C on sublattice 2. The composition space of the phase can then be considered in Fig. 5.4 below as consisting of four compounds, the so-called ‘end members’, at the corner of each square. The composition of the phase is then encompassed in the space between the four ‘end member’ compounds (Fig. 5.4(a)) and the reference energy surface will look like Fig. 5.4(b).</p><p>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;figures/placeholder.png&quot; alt&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5.4.

The method for describing the Gibbs excess energy can, again, be best shown by using a two-sublattice system (4, B),(C, D), before generalising to a multi-component system. In this alloy A~C, A—D, B-C and B-D interactions are controlled by the Gibbs energy of the compounds AC, BC, AD and BD. Mixing on the sublattices controls A-B and C-D interactions and the simplest form of interaction is a regular solution format such that</p><p>Gils = Va Lp. + vou Bop (5.32) where L°,. and L%¢ py denote regular solution parameters for mixing on the sublattices irrespective of site occupation of the other sublattice.

(5.35) 7</p><p>I) refers to a component array of the first order, where one sublattice contains two components, but the remaining sublattices are occupied by only one component with the summation being taken over all different J1. The type of component array that was introduced in Eq. (5.31) can then be denoted JO and referred to as a component of the zeroth order. Equation (5.35) is general for the case of regular solutions but can be further extended to include interactions of a higher order, as in Eq. (5.34), by introducing the appropriate arrays JZ but with a further restriction that component array must not contain any component more than once in each sublattice. In this way the excess Gibbs energy can be written as</p><p>(co &gt; Pr2(¥)- Liz (5.36)</p><p>Z&gt;0 IZ</p><p>and the total energy of the phase including the reference energy, the ideal entropy and excess terms becomes</p><p>Get =&gt; Pro(¥) -Giy + RT DN? &gt; yi loge y+ )— &gt;- Pra(¥) + Liz. (5.37) 10 s i</p><p>230 1Z</p><p>5.4.3 Applications of the sublattice model</p><p>5.4.3.1 Line compounds. These are phases where sublattice occupation is restricted by particular combinations of atomic size, electronegativity, etc., and there is a well-defined stoichiometry with respect to the components. Many examples occur in transition metal borides and silicides, //I-V compounds and a number of carbides. Although such phases are considered to be stoichiometric in the relevant binary systems, they can have partial or complete solubility of other components with preferential substitution for one of the binary elements. This can be demonstrated for the case of a compound such as the orthorhombic Cr2B-type boride which exists in a number or refractory metal-boride phase diagrams. Mixing then occurs by substitution on the metal sublattice.</p><p>For example in the Fe-Cr-B system (Fig. 5.5) Cr2B extends across the diagram at a constant stoichiometry of boron as (Cr,Fe)2B (Villars and Calvert 1985). Also shown is the corresponding extension of the tetragonal Fe2B compound. Such phases are commonly called ‘line compounds’. Generally, sublattice occupation can be described as</p><p>(A, B, C...),(Z),</p><p>where A, B and C are the elements which mix on the first sublattice and Z is the element with fixed stoichiometry. The Gibbs energy of such a phase can be written</p><p>Gm = So uiG2, + RTuy yf loge ul + &gt; Yo uly} SO Ly(ot - yj)” (6.38)</p><p>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;figures/placeholder.png&quot; alt&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5.5. Partial isothermal section for \(Fe-Cr-B\) showing stoichiometric behaviour of the \((Cr,Fe)_{2}B\) compound.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p><p>where i and j denote the elements mixing on sublattice 1 while Z is the stoichiometric element. u is the molar number of sites in sublattice 1 and G2, denotes the Gibbs energies of the various compounds when sublattice 1 is com- pletely occupied by one of the components mixing on sublattice 1. The excess energy term is associated only with interactions between the components on the first sublattice. Because of the fixed stoichiometry, mole fractions can straight- forwardly be expressed as 1; = (u/(u + v)) y} and Eq. (5.38) becomes equivalent to the line compound models used by Kaufman and Bernstein (1970).</p><p>5.4.3.2 Interstitial phases. These are predominant in steels and ferrous-based alloys, where elements such as C and N occupy the interstitial sites of the ferrite and austenite lattices. In this case the structure of the phase can be considered as consisting of two sublattices, one occupied by substitutional elements, such as Fe, Cr, Ni, Mn, etc., and the other occupied by the interstitial elements, such as C or N, and interstitial vacancies (Va). As the concentration of C, N,..., etc., increases the interstitial vacancies are filled until there is complete occupation. The occupation of the sublattices is shown below as</p><p>(Fe, Cr, Ni, Mn...), (Va, C, N...),-</p><p>In the case of an f.c.c.__Al structure, with u= v= 1, the state of complete occupation of interstitial carbon corresponds to a MC carbide with the NaC] lattice. For the c.p.h._A3 structure, with u = 1 and v = 0.5, complete occupation of the interstitial sites by carbon gives the M2C carbide with a hexagonal Fe2N-type structure.</p><p>For the case of the f.c.c._Al, austenite phase in Cr-Fe-C, the Gibbs energy of the phase is represented by the formula (Cr, Fe), (C, Va); and its Gibbs energy given by the following equation</p><p>Gm = Vora Gerve + Urea Reva + YorveCErc</p><ul><li>UreveGPuc + RT (1- (yo, log. vor + vee loge Yee)</li></ul><p>+1: (vlog. ve + Ha loge Vis))</p><ul><li><p>abate (SO Hessevalits~ vh)&quot;)</p></li><li><p>ubsvhe (30 Here (vts—¥h)&quot;)</p></li></ul><p>+ibatsin (So Lcwlié-#,)&#39;)</p><ul><li>vbatah (SO Uheclib ut&quot;). )</li></ul><p>The first two terms represent the Gibbs energy of f.c.c.<em>Al Cr and Fe because the second sublattice consists entirely of unfilled interstitial sites. The next two terms represent the Gibbs energy of the CrC and FeC compounds which are formed when all of the interstitial sites of the f.c.c.</em>A1 lattice are filled with C. The second line is the ideal entropy term while the last four lines correspond to the excess term. It can be seen that, when we =0, the model reduces to Eq. (5.21) for the simple substitutional mixing of Cr and Fe. This is particularly useful as thermodynamic assessments of metallic binary systems can be extended to include interstitial elements without the need for changing any of the existing parameters.</p><p>5.4.3.3 Complex intermetallic compounds with significant variation in stoichio- metry. In many binary systems intermetallic compounds may exhibit significant solubility and there may be more than two crystallographic sublattices to consider. This is the case for compounds such as the a, 1, x and Laves phases, and in such circumstances the sublattice model should, as closely as possible, follow the internal sublattice structure of the compound itself. Taking the case of oc, this consists of five crystallographically distinct sublattices occupied by atoms in the ratio 2:4:8:8:8 (Villars and Calvert 1991). The total number of atoms per unit cell is then 30. Full mixing of all components on all sublattices yields a prohibitively high number of variables, making a CALPHAD calculation in a multi-component system almost impossible. Even modelling the phase in a binary would be extremely difficult and some simplification is necessary.</p><p>This can be achieved for o by considering two types of components differen- tiated almost exclusively by size considerations. The sublattice occupation can then be simplified. One possibility is to consider o as either (A, B)6(A, B)1o(B)4 where the first and third sublattices and fourth and fifth sublattices are ‘joined’, i.e., site occupation of A and B atoms are considered to be equal on the sites. Alternatively (A, B)i6(A)i0(B)4 may be used where mixing is considered only to occur on the fourth and fifth sublattices (Ansara et al. 1997). The latter occupation arises when solubility of B components is small in the second sublattice, as appears to be the case for most o phases. The consequence of this simplification is that the sublattice formula for the Co-Mo @ phase is given by (Co, Mo)j6(Co)19(Mo), and the Gibbs energy is then</p><p>Gm = GSo.coito + Ghtorcoato + PT (16 » (Yio !08e Yo + Yeo 108s Yito))</p><ul><li>tbsthotbstho (3 Htaswcome(tls~ th)”: (6.0)</li></ul><p>:</p><p>As ydo = tuto = 1, Eq. (5.40) becomes rather like Eq. (5.21) in that mixing is simplified to two components on a single sublattice but the points of complete occupation do not reach pure Co or Mo. The expressions for Gibbs energy become more complex when, with the addition of further elements, mixing can occur on all sublattices as in the case of Ni~Co-Mo-W. Here the sublattice formula would be (Ni, Co, Mo, W):6(Ni, Co)io(Mo, W),, but this degree of complexity can be handled straightforwardly by most current software.</p><p>5.4.3.4 Order-disorder transformations. The previous examples considered strict site preference for the components in sublattice phases. For example, in the (Cr, Fe)2B compound, B is not considered to mix on the metal sublattice, nor are Cr and Fe considered to mix on the B sublattice. This strict limitation on occupancy does not always occur. Some phases, which have preferential site occupation of elements on different sublattices at low temperatures, can disorder at higher temperatures with all elements mixing randomly on all sublattices.</p><p>It was demonstrated by Sundman (1985) and later by Ansara et al. (1988) that an otder—disorder transformation could be modelled by setting specific restrictions on the parameters of a two-sublattice phase. One of the first phases to be considered was an A3B-ordered compound. In such circumstances the sublattice formula (A, B)3(A, B) can be applied and the possible relationships between site fractions and mole fractions are given in Figure 5.6. The dashed lines denoted rg = 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 show variations in order of the phase while the composition is maintained constant. When these lines cross the diagonal joining A34 and B3B the phase has disordered completely as y}, = y3 = xg. AS the lines go toward the boundary edge the phase orders and, at the side and comers of the composition square, there is complete ordering of A and B on the sublattices.</p><p>The two-sublattice order-disorder model (2SLOD) requires first that the Gibbs energy should always have an extremum along the diagonal representing the disordered state with respect to fluctuations in site fractions at constant composition. Further, when the disordered phase is stable this extremum must be a minimum. By assuming that G9., and G3. are zero and applying the above conditions it is possible to define interconnected parameters for the various values</p><p>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;figures/placeholder.png&quot; alt&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5.6.

For the case of an A3B compound one solution gives (Ansara et al. 1988)</p><p>Gig =u GB.a = U2 Lipa = 8u; + u2/2 + 3ug</p><p>Lips = uy /2 + 3uz + 3ug Ling = 2/2 + us Dh.ap = 11/2 + us</p><p>Lipa = 34 Tips = 3us Tha = U4 Lhap = 4s Tipap = 4uy — dus. (5.41)</p><p>The above terms give the ordering contribution to the total energy, and to provide the necessary disordered energy it was necessary to add further terms. This is done by using the relationships</p><p>tasu-yytu-y, and rg=u-yhtu-ys (5.42)</p><p>where u and v are the number of sites on sublattices 1 and 2. Replacing x4 and zg in Eq. (5.21), expanding and comparing with the formula for the two-sub-lattice model, an equivalence in Gibbs energy between the disordered substitutional solid solution and a two-sublattice model can be obtained if the following parameters are used (Saunders 1989):</p><p>Gig = uv- D9, + uv(u—v)- Lig + uv(u— 0) Lap G84 = uv 12, —uv(u—v)- Lig + uv(u—v)&quot;- Dap Lipa =u. 19, + 3u’v- Lh, + u’v(5u— 2u)- Lag Tipe =u? - Lip — 3u’v- Lig + u’v(5v ~ 2u)- Lig Lipa =U - Lhg + 4u&#39;v- Lig Lipp =v: Lip — 4u&#39;v- Lip Thea =ul- Tha Tes aul.

(5.21) (note L replaces Q in the above notation). Adding the ordered and disordered part together provides the total Gibbs energy of the phase both in the ordered and disordered state. This method was used by Gros (1987), Ansara et al. (1988) and Saunders (1989) and, in general, calculations give quite reasonable results. However, the model proved to have some flaws (Saunders 1996). Firstly, when asymmetrical terms for the ordering energies are used (i.¢., u; # U2) they give rise to a residual, extraneous excess Gibbs energy when the phase disorders and there is no longer an equivalence in Gibbs energy between the 2SLOD model and the original disordered phase. Secondly, when the disordered part is extended to higher order systems there is an incompatibility with the substitutional model when sub-regular or higher terms are used for the various L°!? parameters in Eq. (5.43).</p><p>Some of the problems with the model were addressed in later work by Dupin (1995) who used a more complex formulation for the ordering parameters. Firstly, the ordering contribution was separated from disordered contribution and added straightforwardly to the Redlich-Kister energy polynomial. This also made it simpler to combine with a Redlich-Kister model and removed the need for re- formatting existing phases already modelled using this format. Secondly, the extraneous excess energies from the ordering parameters were empirically removed such that the excess Gibbs energy due to the ordered parameters became zero on disordering. The Gibbs energy is then expressed as a sum of three terms</p><p>2</p><p>Gm = Gin (ai) + Gar (uly?) — Gr (ut = aii 9</p><p>(5.44)</p><p>where Gils(2;) is the Gibbs energy contribution of the disordered state, Go&quot;4(y}y?) is the Gibbs energy contribution due to ordering and G°4(y! = 2;; y? = 2) is a term which represents the extraneous excess energy contribution from the ordered parameters when the phase disorders. A more accurate representation of the Ni~Al diagram was achieved using this model (Dupin 1995) and the work was extended to Ni-AI-Ti-Cr and Ni-Al-Ta-Cr.</p><p>However, the empirical removal of the residual, extraneous energies, Gad (y} = 24; y? = 2;), causes internal inconsistencies in the model. For example, in an ordered compound such as an AB or A3B type, it is possible that the Gibbs energy which is actually calculated for the fully ordered state is quite different from that specified for G74 or Cry (Saunders 1996). It would therefore be better if the model was derived in such a way that these extraneous energies did not arise. This is actually the case when ordering energies are symmetrical in the form where G4.2 = Gh.q and LY y. = L?4 g = —G9.q (Saunders 1989). This is equivalent to the conditions of the Bragg—Williams-Gorsky model of Inden (1975a, 1975b, 1977a, 1977b). However, this limits the model when it is applied to phases such as Ti3Al and Ni3Al where substantial asymmetries are apparent.</p><p>The empirical nature of the 2SLOD model is such that it cannot be considered a true ordering model in its own right and is therefore included in this chapter rather than the more fundamental chapter on ordering (Chapter 7). However, Sundman and Mohri (1990), using a hybrid sublattice model, showed it was possible to model the Cu-Au system such that it closely matched the phase diagram achieved by a Monte-Carlo method (see Chapter 7). This was done by combining a four-sublattice model, with composition-independent interaction energies, and a gas cluster model for the short-range ordering which was modified to account for a restriction in the degrees of freedom in the solid state. The sublattice model was equivalent to a classical Bragg~Williams (1934) treatment at low temperatures and therefore remains a basic ordering treatment. To model complex ordering systems such as Ti-Al it is almost certainly necessary to include at least third nearest-neighbour interchange energies (Pettifor 1995).</p><p>5.5. IONIC LIQUID MODELS</p><p>Phase diagrams containing ionic liquids, such as slag systems and molten salts, can be complex and show apparently contradictory behaviour. For example the SiOz-CaO phase diagram shows liquid immiscibility as well as thermodynamically stable compounds. Immiscibility is usually associated with positive deviations from ideality and, at first sight, is not consistent with compound-forming systems which exhibit large negative deviations. Such features arise from a complex Gibbs energy change with composition and, although the Gibbs energy of mixing can be negative over the whole composition range, inflections in the mixing curve give rise to spinodal points with subsequent decomposition to two liquids (Taylor and Dinsdale 1990). The use of simple mixture models for ionic liquids has not been successful. They need large numbers of coefficients to mimic the sharp changes in enthalpy around critical compositions, and binary systems thus modelled tend to predict the behaviour of multi-component systems badly.</p><p>Many models have been proposed to account for the thermodynamic behaviour of ionic liquids and some important ones are listed below:</p><p>(1) Cellular models</p><p>(2) Modified quasichemical models (3) Sublattice models</p><p>(4) Associated solution models</p><p>The above is not intended to be a definitive list but rather to indicate some of the more commonly used models at the present time. Other, more historical, models have been used extensively, for example the polymerisation models of Toop and Samis (1962) and Masson (1965), the models of Flood (1954), Richardson (1956) and Yokakawa and Niwa (1969). More recently the ‘central atom’ model by Satsri and Lahiri (1985, 1986) and the ‘complex’ model of Hoch and Arpshofen (1984) have been proposed. Each has been used with some success in lower-order systems, but the extension to multicomponent systems is not always straightforward.</p><p>5.5.1 The cellular model</p><p>Kapoor and Frohberg (1973) applied this model to the ternary system CaO-FeO-Si02. They envisaged that mixing occurred by formation of three ‘asymmetric cells’ obtained by a reaction between ‘symmetric cells’ of the metallic oxides and silica. For CaO-SiO,, the formation energy for the asymmetric cell is denoted Wjs, where the subscripts / and S denote the combination of ‘symmetric’ cells from CaO and SiO,. In addition interactions between the various symmetric and asymmetric cells were considered such that</p><p>Erss = 2€15,55 (5.45)</p><p>where €7,55 denotes the interaction between the symmetric CaO and SiO, cells and €7s,s the interaction between the asymmetric cell formed between CaO and SiO, and the symmetric silica cell. This is expanded with the addition of FeO so that the two further asymmetric cells are formed with energies Wys and W,;, where J denotes the FeO cell, and the additional interaction energies between the cells were related in the following way:</p><p>E198 = E1s,ss + Es5,58 (5.45a)</p><p>where €ys,ss is the interaction energy between the asymmetric cell formed between FeO and SiO, and the silica cell. It was further assumed that interactions terms were negligibly small in comparison to the cell formation energies and that €ys,55/kT and €js,55/kT were small compared to unity. Based on these assumptions they were able to define the Gibbs energy of mixing in a system such as CaQ-FeO-SiQ, as</p><p>Griz _ 3555 1, (0 =a)</p><p>Soe log,(1 — Ns) ~ Nrlog, Nr — Ny log, Ns</p><ul><li>(Nr — Ris — R13) log.(Nr — Ris — Rrs)</li><li>(Ny — Rus — Ris) log.(Ny — Ras — Ris)</li><li>(Ns — Ris — Rus) log,(Ns — Rrs — Rus)</li><li>2Rys log, Ris + 2Rys log, Rys + 2Rrz log, Rry</li></ul><p>4 2WisRis + 2WisRas 4 2Wrs Riz</p><p>RT RT RT 2e(1 — Ns)(Ns — Ris — Rus)</p><ul><li>P (5.46)</li></ul><p>with</p><p>Nj ==</p><blockquote><p>ny + 2ng</p></blockquote><p>7</p><p>and</p><p>ns Ns =—— SS</p><blockquote><p>75 + Ins</p></blockquote><p>a</p><p>where i denotes either CaO or FeO and n; and ng denote the number of moles of CaO, FeO and SiO2.

In Eq. (5.46) it can be seen that the first five lines correspond to the configurational entropy term. This is no longer ideal because of preferential formation of the various asymmetrical cells and the system effectively orders. This is a feature of ionic systems and gives rise to forms of quasichemical entropy which will also be discussed in the next section.</p><p>From the above equations, activities of metallic oxides and silica were calculated for various binary slag systems and CaO-FeO-SiO2 and found to be in good agreement. The drawback of the model is that equivalents need to be made between various anionic and cationic types and problems can arise when these are poly- valent. Also, considering that only a ternary system was considered, the expressions for Gibbs energy are complex in comparison to the simple mixture and sublattice types. Gaye and Welfringer (1984) extended this model to multi-component systems but the treatment is too lengthy to consider here.</p><p>5.5.2 Modified quasichemical models</p><p>A modified form of the quasichemical model of Guggenheim (1935) and Fowler and Guggenheim (1939) has recently been developed by Pelton and Blander (1986a, 1986b, 1988) for application to ionic liquids. The model considers that the liquid has a strong tendency to order around specific compositions, associated with specific physical or chemical phenomena. This was considered to be a general feature of ionic liquids and that previous attempts at modelling of ordered salts and silicate slags were either too specific in nature to the type of system, i.e., oxide or halide, or too complicated for general usage, particularly when considering extrap- olation to higher-order systems. The model is therefore phenomenological in nature which has the advantage that it can be widely applied.</p><p>First, consider a binary liquid A~B in which A and B atoms mix substitutionally on a quasi-lattice with coordination number Z. There is the possibility that A-B pairs will be formed from A-A and B-B pairs by the following relation</p><p>(A—A) + (B~B) = (A-B).</p><p>The molar enthalpy and entropy change of this reaction, denoted respectively w and 7 by Pelton and Blander (1986a, 1986b, 1988), is given by (w — nT). If this is zero the solution is ideal. However, if (w— nT) is negative then there will be ordering of the mixture around the 50:50 composition and the enthalpy and entropy of mixing will show distinct minima at the AB composition. As ordering does not always occur at AB it is desirable to allow other compositions to be chosen for the position of the minima, which is done by replacing mole fractions with equivalent fractions ya and yg where</p><p>me Bata Bata+ Bare</p><p>Bare</p><p>do yp =e one 98 Fea + Baap</p><p>(5.49) where (4 and @g are numbers chosen so that y4 = yg = 0.5 at the composition of maximum ordering.

The general applicability of the model is demonstrated by the recent work of Eriksson et al. (1993) who are in the process of creating a comprehensive database for the system SiO,—Al,0;-CaO-MgO-MnO-FeO-Na,O-K,0-TiO,-Ti,03-ZrO,S.</p><p>5.5.3 Sublattice models</p><p>Essentially, sublattice models originate from the concepts of Temkin (1945) who proposed that two separate sublattices exist in a solid-state crystal for cations and anions. The configurational entropy is then governed by the site occupation of the various cations and anions on their respective sublattices. When the valence of the cations and anions on the sublattices are equal, and electroneutrality is maintained, the model parameters can be represented as described in Section 5.4.2. However, when the valence of the cations and anions varies, the situation becomes more complex and some additional restrictions need to be made. These can be expressed by considering equivalent fractions (f) which, for a sublattice phase with the formula (I+, J+3...)(M-™, N-&quot;...), are given by</p><p>(5.57a)</p><p>and</p><p>uh (5.57b) “me where i and m are the valences of I and M respectively. These replace site</p><p>fractions in the general expressions for the Gibbs energy reference and excess mixing terms. The ideal mixing term is given as (Pelton 1988)</p><p>ca (su) * (Sree was) (Spt) (5.58)</p><p>This approach works well for systems where no neutral ions exist and a database for the system (Li, Na, K)(F, Cl, OH, CO3, SO,) has been developed (Pelton 1988) which gives good estimates for activities in multi-component liquids. However, the above approach is more limited in the presence of neutral ions which are necessary if one wishes to model ionic liquids which may contain neutrals such as S,</p><p>To overcome this problem an extension of the sublattice model was proposed by Hillert et al. (1985) which is now known as the ionic two-sublattice model for liquids. As in the previous case it uses constituent fractions as composition vari- ables, but it also considers that vacancies, with a charge corresponding to the charge of the cations, can be introduced on the anion sublattice so that the composition can move away from the ideal stoichiometry and approach an element with an electro- positive character. The necessary neutral species of an electronegative element are added to the anion sublattice in order to allow the composition to approach a pure element. The sublattice formula for the model can then be written as</p><p>(Cf&quot;)p (45, Va, ) (5.59)</p><p>where C represents cations, A anions, Va hypothetical vacancies and B neutrals. The charge of an ion is denoted v; and the indices i, j and k are used to denote specific constituents. For the following description of the model, superscripts 0, v and 0 will be excluded unless needed for clarity. The number of sites on the sublattices is varied so that electroneutrality is maintained and values of P and Q are calculated from the equation</p><p>P=) yy, + Qyva (5.60a) 7</p><p>and Q= se, (6.606)</p><p>Egs (5.60a) and (5.60b) simply mean that P and Q are equal to the average charge on the opposite sublattice with the hypothetical vacancies having an induced charge equal to Q.

The first line represents the Gibbs energy reference state, the second line the configurational mixing term and the last three lines the excess Gibbs energy of mixing. As the list of excess parameters is long and the subscript notation is complex, it is worth giving some specific examples for these parameters after Sundman (1996):</p><p>Liyizg — tepresents the interaction between two cations in the presence of a common anion; for example Lcq+2,qg+?,0-2 Tepresents an interaction term from the system CaO-MgO.</p><p>Lijiz:va Tepresents interactions between metallic elements; for example Loa mg in Ca-Mg.</p><p>Lj.j  Tepresents interactions between two anions in the presence of a common cation; for example Leq+2.9n-1,co;? in Ca(OH)2-CaCOs.</p><p>Li.jz represents interactions between an anion and a neutral atom; for example Dye+2,s-2g in the S-rich part of Fe-S.</p><p>Li:vak represents interactions between a metal and a neutral; for example Dret?.vac in Fe-C.</p><p>Lk,,k2  Fepresents interactions between two neutrals; for example Lsi,n,,sio, in Si;N4-SiO}. It should be noted that the cation is irrelevant here as the number of cation sites has become zero when only neutrals are taken into account.</p><p>The model is certainly complex, but perhaps no more so than previous ionic liquid models described in Sections 5.5.1 and 5.5.2. The initial experience (Selleby</p><ol><li>suggests that the number of terms needed to describe a ternary system such</li></ol><p>as Fe-Mn-S is quite similar for both ionic two-sublattice liquid and associate models (see next section). The modelling of ionic liquids is, in the main, complex and the advantages of the various techniques can only become apparent as they become more commonly used.</p><p>There are a number of immediate advantages to the two-sublattice ionic liquid model. The first is that it becomes identical to the more usual Redlich—Kister representation of metallic systems when the cation sublattice contains only vacancies. This immediately allows data from an assessed metallic system to be combined with data from an oxide system so that the full range of compositions is covered. In binary cases the model can be made equivalent to an associated model. For example in Cu-S the associated mode! would consider a substitutional solution of Cu, S and Cu,S. If an ionic two-sublattice model with a formula (Cu*&#39;)p(S, Va, S)g is used, it is straightforward to derive parameters to give identical results to the associate model. However, it should be noted that the Gibbs energy of the two models does not remain equivalent if they are extended into ternary and higher- order systems (Hillert et al. 1985).</p><p>5.5.4 Associated solution models</p><p>There are a number of papers dealing with the associated models (Predel and Oehme 1974, Sommer 1977, Sharma and Chang 1979, Chuang et al. 1981, Bjérkman 1985) which are all very similar in principle. There are differences in the way the excess terms are handled, but all consider that some type of complex or associate is formed inside the liquid from a reaction between the components of the system in question. The thermodynamic properties of the liquid then depend predominantly on the Gibbs energy of formation of these complexes, or associates, rather than by interactions between the components. This gives rise to enthalpy of mixing diagrams which are characterised by sharp changes at critical compositions where the associate(s) exist and also by markedly non-ideal mixing entropies.</p><p>The derivation of Sommer (1977, 1980, 1982) can be used as an example. This considers the formation of a single associate with a formula A,B; within a binary system A-B. It is assumed the liquid contains n4, and ng, number of moles of ‘free’ A and B in equilibrium with m4,p, number of moles of the associate A:B;. The mole fractions of A, B and A;B,, in a binary alloy containing 1 mole of A and B atoms, are then given by the formula</p><p>TA=NA, +inas; Tea=Np, +jnas, and A,B, = NAB, (5.63)</p><p>The excess Gibbs energy of mixing is then given by the general formula GB, = G+ G&#39;s (5.64)</p><p>G*™ is the Gibbs energy due to the formation of the associate defined as G™ = naj, CAB, (5.65)</p><p>where G4, B; is the Gibbs energy of formation of one mole of the associate. G™® considers the Gibbs energy due to the interactions between the components A and B themselves and with the associate A,B; such that</p><p>NA, NB, NA, A,B, B, NA,B, Gh = CE 4 Og Ot OB (5.66)</p><p>where n = na, + Ng, + 74,8,. The configurational entropy is given simply by scot — —R(na, log. ca + ne, log, zB + 14,5, log, £4,B,)- (5.67)</p><p>The model was applied to numerous ionic melts and good agreement was found with experimental results (Sommer 1982). One of the main criticisms of the associate formalism has been that, although the concept considers associates or complexes to be ‘diffuse’ in nature, the mathematical formalism implies that distinct molecules exist, which is harder to justify. However, if this stringent view is relaxed, it can be seen that the model merely implies some underlying structure to the liquid, which is quite reasonable, and it does provide functions which allow for the temperature dependence of the enthalpy of mixing. A more serious criticism is that some knowledge of the relevant associate is necessary before Eqs (5.64)-(5.67) can be applied. The most appropriate associate can be selected by fitting of experimental results for enthalpies of mixing which is sufficient in a large number of cases. However, in some systems there may be a number of different associates and it is not always obvious as to which types actually exist. The main advantages of the associate models is that they allow a simple strategy to be adopted for optimisation. It is further easy to define ternary and higher-order associates and extend the model to multi-component systems. For example, Bjérkman (1985) showed this to good effect in the system Fe-O-SiO2.</p><p>To complete this section it is interesting to show the equivalence between the ionic two-sublattice model and the associate model as demonstrated by Hillert et al. (1985). Equation (5.62) can be simplified for a system (A+), (B**®, Va-&quot;4, B°) 9 where +va = —vb to become, for one mole of atoms,</p><p>Gn VE FAceB/ vay, + RT (yp log, ys + yolog. yp + yva log. Yva) + Grix/VA ~ yBuB (0-7)</p><p>where y is the site fraction occupation of the neutral B° on sublattice Q.

The equivalences break down in ternary and higher-order systems as there is the introduction of more compositional variables in the associate model than for the two-sublattice case. This was considered (Hillert et al. 1985) to demonstrate the advantages of the sub-lattice model, but as mentioned previously it turns out that the number of excess terms to describe Fe-Mn-S is very similar.</p><p>5.6 AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS</p><p>Aqueous solutions form a large area for thermodynamic modelling and hold great importance in their own right. However, they are, by definition, basically dilute solutions and almost all models deal exclusively with the thermodynamic properties of the aqueous solution, only considering some possible precipitation reactions of insoluble, mainly stoichiometric, compounds. The integration of these models into concentrated solution databases which are often used at high tempera- tures has therefore not been seriously undertaken by any group as far as the authors are aware. There has, however, been quite significant use of aqueous models in conjunction with substance databases for prediction of thermodynamic properties and solubility products in a number of important areas such as corrosion and geochemistry. To this end some discussion of aqueous modelling is worthwhile.</p><p>One of the main conceptual differences between the models discussed so far and aqueous solutions is that the units which are used to define thermodynamic functions are often different. This is because they apply to the properties which are actually measured for aqueous systems, and molarity (c;) and molality (m,) are far more common units than mole fraction. Molarity is defined as</p><p>10-37; c= (5.72) and molality as m= mi (5.73) nw My</p><p>where M,, is the molar mass of water and V the volume of the solution in m3. The partial ideal mixing term for component i, (Gi4*) can be defined with respect to molality as</p><p>Gites! — Ge + RT log, (mi) (5.74)</p><p>where G? is the chemical potential of component i in its standard state. This can be combined with some term for the partial excess Gibbs energy so that the chemical potential of i can be defined. The excess Gibbs energy term is defined using the ionic strength (J) where</p><p>1=05&gt; mz (5.75)</p><p>where z; is the charge in electron units of the component i. This can be used to define the limiting excess Gibbs energy of an electrolyte solution containing cations of charge z* and anions of charge z~ via the Debye—Hiickel limiting law as A apn, (5.76) (nw My RT) 3</p><p>References are listed on pp. 124-126.</p><p>Differentiation of Eq.

(5.77)</p><p>The above equation assumes that the ions are point charges and interact in a continuous dielectric.

This expression can be used up to ionic strengths of 5x 10&quot;? (Davies 1985) but for higher concentrations further terms are needed. One of the simplest expressions is to consider a linear term with respect to ionic strength such that</p><p>2 AVT k 4 = —+—_ + BI 5.79 087 (i+ Bayi *® (5.79) or, more generally, -2AVT i I ;= et r. 5.80) 8 = To Ba) uA (5.80)</p><p>By considering Ba; as a single adjustable parameter, data can then be fitted using only Ba; and f as variables.

(5.82)</p><p>A further approach is to consider a more specific form of ion interaction and replace Eq.

The Debye— Hiickel term then has similarities with the Davies equation in that Ba; is made equal to unity.</p><p>One of the main models which is available in CALPHAD calculation pro- grammes is that based on Pitzer (1973, 1975), Pitzer and Mayorga (1973) and Pitzer and Kim (1974). The model is based on the development of an explicit function relating the ion interaction coefficient to the ionic strength and the addition of a third virial coefficient to Eq. (5.83). For the case of an electrolyte MX the excess Gibbs energy is given by</p><p>=fD FLY AM mim + YY minmimjm, (5.85) ij tog ok with</p><p>j= At Toga(t +1.2VT)</p><p>where ,;(I) and jj, are second and third virial coefficients from the non- electrostatic part of G74, mix, and A? is the Debye-Hiickle limiting slope. 4:3, is taken to be independent of ionic strength and set to zero if ions i, j and k have the same charge sign. Equation (5.86) is similar in form to the excess terms considered for simple mixture phases, except that some specific terms arising from the unique properties of aqueous systems are included. Differentiation of Eq. (5.85) with Tespect to concentration yield the following expression for activity coefficients of cation (M), anion (X) and neutral species (N) (Clegg and Brimblecombe 1989)</p><p>(5.86)</p><p>loge 1m = ZF + Lim(2Bue + ZCma) + Lm (20 + Tote] @</p><p>Y</p><p>meme hae + Jul Sm</p><p>@ &lt;a’</p><p>+2 made +32Yo mymesnase (5.87a) n j ok</p><p>loge7x = %F + D&gt; me(2Bex + ZCex) + D&gt; Me (20. + Dmx)</p><ul><li>OY meme xce + lel 9S D&gt; me Ma Coa</li></ul><p>€ &lt;c ©</p><p>+23 mp Arn t3 &gt; dom; Mk BXjk (5.87b) n jk</p><p>loge tv = 2) &gt; ma Ava +2) me Ave +2) Ma Ave +3) dM Ms Lis 7 © a 7 (5.87¢)</p><p>where the subscripts c, a, and n represent cations, anions and neutrals respectively.

There are a number of articles which can be recommended to give the reader some idea of what can be achieved with aqueous models. Harvie and Weare (1980) developed a model for calculating mineral solubilities in natural waters based on the Pitzer equations which achieved good accuracy up to strengths of 20 m. This work was extended by Harvie et al. (1982, 1984) so that a database exists for the prediction of mineral solubilities in water up to high ionic strengths at 25°C for the system Na, K, Mg, Ca, H, Cl, S04, OH, HCO3, CO3, CO2, H20. More recently Clegg and Brimblescombe (1989) presented a database, again using the Pitzer model, for the solubility of ammonia in. aqueous and multi-component solutions for the system Li, Na, Mg, NH4, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, F, Cl, Br, I, OH, CNS, NO3, NO2, C103, ClO4, S, SO;, CH;COO, HCOO and (COO),, H20. Further models and applications can be found in articles by Zemaitis (1980) and Grenthe and Wanner (1988). The review of Davies (1985) also gives details of software programmes which are available for calculating equilibria in aqueous solutions.</p><p>REFERENCES</p><p>Ansara, I. (1979) Int. Met.
