to consider a magnetic contribution to the Gibbs energy if this condition is taken to be the standard state. However in ferromagnetic, anti- ferromagnetic and ferri-magnetic materials, there is also competition between different spin arrangements and the enthalpy of certain transition metals, rare earths and their associated alloys and compounds are lowered by specific forms of spin polarisation. This includes the technologically important elements Fe, Ni and Co and their alloys and the effect can be of sufficient magnitude to have a major effect on phase transformation.</p><p>There are many different forms of spin polarisation. The ferromagnetism exhibited by b.c.c. Fe is probably the best-known variant. Here the coupling between atoms favours parallel spin configurations between nearest neighbours and the critical ordering temperature is known as the Curie temperature (7). In other materials the exchange forces favour anti-parallel spins between nearest neighbours. If there is only one species of atoms this is known as anti-ferromagnetism and the critical ordering temperature is known as the Neel temperature (T,,). If the anti-parallel coupling involves more than one species of atoms with different values of spin, there will be a net spin in one particular direction. Such a material, e.g., Fe304, is considered to be ferri-magnetic and again behaves like a ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature.</p><p>Many other subtle differences can occur, such as periodic changes in the crystallographic direction in which the spins are orientated, but these details are rarely considered in thermodynamic terms. In the treatments which follow, it is sufficient to note that the quantum number s = +&#39;4 or — defines the spin-up or spin-down direction for individual electrons, while the magnitude of any magnetic effects depends on the number of electrons that are being polarised. The unit magnetic moment associated with spin “4 is equal to a Bohr magneton (zg) and the number of magnetic electrons/atom is defined by the symbol {, so that @ = 2s (Bozorth 1956).</p><p>Unlike chemical ordering, which can only occur in alloys, magnetic ordering can occur in unary systems and the magnetic Gibbs energy turns out to be sufficiently large to cause fundamental changes in structure. For example, the high-temperature</p><p>229  =========== 230 N. Saunders and A. P. Miodownik</p><p>form of solid Fe is 6 which has a b.c.c. structure and transforms to 7-Fe with the more close-packed f.c.c. structure at 1394°C. Both of these phases are para- magnetic at these elevated temperatures, but the onset of ferromagnetism in the b.c.c. phase causes this phase to reappear at 912°C as a-Fe. This makes Fe a unique element in that the high-temperature allotrope reappears at low temperatures, and it should be noted that the thermodynamic effect due to short-range magnetic order is already sufficient to cause the re-appearance of the b.c.c. form; a-Fe only becomes ferromagnetic below its Curie temperature at 770°C. At 0 K the magnetic enthalpy (%9000 J mol?) is an order of magnitude larger than was involved in the 6—~ high temperature transformation (900 J mol).</p><p>The change in Gibbs energy with temperature of Fe, with respect to the para- magnetic form 6-Fe, is shown in Fig. 8.1(a). This can be correlated directly with the value of the magnetic specific heat (Fig. 8.1(b)) (Nishizawa et al.. 1979), which in turn is related to a corresponding change in the saturation magnetisation, 3, (Fig. 8.1(c)) (Nishizawa 1978). The critical magnetic ordering temperature, the Curie temperature (T.), is defined either by the peak in C7* or by the maximum rate of change in the variation of 8 with T. The situation is made more complex on alloying as both T, and (3 vary with composition.</p><p>It has already been mentioned in the previous chapter that the Ising model, which underlies the formalism used for most chemical ordering treatments, was originally used to describe magnetic transitions. It is, however, technically only valid if the various magnetic states correspond to multiples of the unit magnetic spin, s. Early attempts to describe the associated thermodynamic functions within formal ordering theory were by Saito et al. (1959), Arita (1978) and Moran-Lopez and Falicov (1979). More recent examples of the combination of chemical and magnetic ordering, as applied to b.c.c. Fe-base alloys, have been given by Inden and Pitsch (1991) and Kosakai and Miyazaki (1994). The BWG treatment appears to be a reasonable assumption in such systems because the saturation magnetisation of Fe (2.2 1g) is close to the integral value @ = 2 which is equivalent to s = 1. However, the concentration dependence of the saturation magnetisation, and the important role played by magnetic short-range order, makes it difficult to use such a treatment in the general case and it has been necessary to devise alternative methodologies to describe the magnetic Gibbs energy of alloy systems.</p><p>8.1.1 Polynomial representation of magnetic Gibbs energy</p><p>While acknowledging that the ‘Gibbs energy anomaly’ was associated with magnetism, early attempts to characterise the behaviour of Fe, did not derive G™™* explicitly from ferromagnetic parameters such as @. Instead, G™® was derived either by the direct graphical integration of C7** or simply incorporated into the overall Gibbs energy difference between the y- and a-phases in Fe by means of a global polynomial expression such as used by Kaufman and Nesor (1973)</p><p>References are listed on pp. 256-258.  =========== CALPHAD—A Comprehensive Guide 231</p><p>[4G}™*8/kJ-mot-!</p><p>0 400 800 1200 1600</p><p>C8 [}/mol/K]</p><p>0 400 800 1200 1600 Temp/ K</p><p>Figure 8.1.

(8.1)</li></ul><p>Different temperature regions then required different sets of coefficients and, in specific systems, the coefficients had to be modified when used to describe the low- temperature martensitic transformation (Kaufman and Cohen 1956). It soon became evident that it was preferable to work with functions that properly reflected the physical origin of the extra Gibbs energy. This was also important when moving from pure Fe to increasingly complex steels, as specific heat measurements are not often as generally available as measurements of @ or T..</p><p>8.1.2 Consideration of the best reference state</p><p>The first step is to consider the methods which can be used to represent the change of magnetisation with temperature, and how this can be translated into the corresponding change of G™<em>. By analogy with configurational ordering, it would be reasonable to choose the ground state at 0 K as the fundamental reference point. This view was taken by Zener (1955) who may be considered the first author to try and obtain an explicit description of G™</em>. However, many important phase changes are associated with the high-temperature behaviour, especially the region where short-range magnetic order is present. Starting at 0 K therefore presents certain problems. Firstly, an accurate representation of the temperature dependence of the magnetic parameters is required, and this can be highly non-linear. Secondly, anomalies can arise if there is a rapid variation of the magnetic ordering temperature with composition (Inden 1991). This is particularly true if T, reaches zero in the middle of a system. Finally, it is necessary to devise a system which can take care of mixtures of magnetic and non-magnetic components.</p><p>In contrast to most treatments of configurational ordering, the high-temperature paramagnetic state has therefore been adopted as the best reference state. Objec- tions to using this state on the grounds that it cannot be retained below T, are unwarranted, as the situation can be considered analogous to using the liquid phase as a reference state at high temperatures.</p><p>8.1.3 Magnitude of the short-range magnetic order component</p><p>The magnetic specific heat shows a marked degree of short-range magnetic order above T, which decreases asymptotically to zero when T&#39; &gt;&gt; T,. Figure 8.2 illus- trates how the equivalent values for Ni are obtained by careful subtraction of other components from the total specific heat (Hofmann et al. 1956). The importance of standardising this procedure has been emphasised by de Fontaine et al. (1995), The fraction (¢) of the total magnetic enthalpy retained above T, is clearly always an important quantity and, by analysing experimental results, Inden (1976) obtained a</p><p>References are listed on pp. 256-258.  =========== CALPHAD—A Comprehensive Guide 233</p><p>Experimental C, (Néel) Experimental C,</p><p>Experimental C, (Sykes &amp; Wilkinson)</p><p>(Sykes &amp; Wilkinson)</p><p>Cp in cal. deg-! mole!</p><p>Subtracted magnetic C,</p><p>From Sykes &amp; Wilkinson From Néel</p><p>From Sykes &amp; Wilkinson Extrapolated</p><p>0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1200 1400 Temperature °K</p><p>Figure 8.2.

Ni and Co while the larger value of ¢ = 0.43 was found for b.c.c. Fe. These values were subsequently assumed equally valid for all other f.c.c. and b.c.c. phases (Hillert and Jarl 1978, Inden 1981a). While this is a reasonable assumption for steels, it may not hold for atoms with larger magnetic moments (de Fontaine et al. 1995). This has been confirmed by a CVM treatment applied to Gd (Schon and Inden 1996). In order to incorporate this result into a semi-empirical treatment suitable for multi-component systems it may be worthwhile to revert to an earlier suggestion (Paskin 1957) that ¢ is a function of s and the nearest-neighbour co-ordination number, (z), stl o= s(z—1)° (6.2)</p><p>8.2. DERIVATION OF THE MAGNETIC ENTROPY</p><p>While it is important to partition the long-range and short-range magnetic com- ponents correctly, the maximum entropy contribution due to magnetism, Sms, is an equally crucial factor.</p><p>8.2.1 Theoretical value for the maximum magnetic entropy Despite the intrinsic complexity of magnetic phenomena, there is general agreement  =========== 234 N. Saunders and A. P. Miodownik</p><p>that the maximum entropy generated by the de-coupling of spins between atoms can be expressed by:</p><p>Smee = Rlog,(2s + 1). (8.3)</p><p>Technically, the values of s are theoretically restricted to integral multiples of s and one should consider the sum of each contributing species, but these values are not always available.</p><p>8.2.2 Empirical value for the maximum magnetic entropy</p><p>The saturation magnetisation @, in 4g per atom, of many materials often corres- ponds to non-integral values of s. This is due to contributions other than s being involved, for example polarised conduction electrons. It is, therefore, general practice to substitute the experimental value of the saturation magnetisation at 0 K, Bp, for 2s in Eq. (8.3) which leads to (Miodownik 1977)</p><p>Smeg = Rlog.(fo + 1). (8.4) 8.2.3 Explicit variation in entropy with magnetic spin number and temperature The magnetic entropy may be rigorously specified if the BWG mean-field approxi- mation is combined with specific values of the magnetic spin. The expression for the magnetic entropy corresponding to s = 4, as a function of the degree of order</p><p>n, is identical to that already given in Eq. (7.2) of the previous chapter on configurational ordering</p><p>Sis = -wha| (52) toge(*£2) + (252) toe C3). (85)</p><p>However, the permutation of permissible spins rapidly becomes more complicated with higher values of s.

DERIVATION OF MAGNETIC ENTHALPY, H™A¢</p><p>8.3.1 Classical derivation The simplest case is to start with a situation where all the atoms have the same spin.</p><p>References are listed on pp. 256-258.  =========== CALPHAD—A Comprehensive Guide 235</p><p>The general expression for the BWG (mean field) approximation then gives N HT = — (k) 76k) 72 52 . 2 » 2) JB 7? 5 (8.7)</p><p>This allows for a summation for magnetic interactions in successive (k-th) neigh- bouring shells but, unless J values can be derived from first-principles calculations, there is generally insufficient experimental data to allow anything other than a single nearest-neighbour interaction parameter to be used. This, then, must be taken to incorporate any other longer-range effects, and application to real alloy systems is also technically restricted by having to use multiples of s = 1/2. Much therefore depends on whether this realistically simulates experimental values of 8, which fortunately seem to be the case in Fe-rich, Co-rich and Ni-rich alloys. However, this is less secure at higher solute concentrations, especially if there are transitions between different forms of magnetism in the system (see Fig. 8.4).</p><p>An equation which includes the effect of adding a magnetic term to the enthalpy of an ordered system has already been given in Section 7.3.2.3 of Chapter 7, but no details were given of how to determine the value of the magnetic interaction energy MY). For a binary alloy A,_,B, this involves the introduction of three magnetic interaction parameters J, we, and J which describe the strength of the coup- ling between nearest-neighbour atoms whose (magnetic) electrons have parallel spins as compared to anti-parallel spins. The magnetic interchange energy M) is then obtained by combining these parameters to yield</p><p>ME) = JO) 4 30) — as). (8.8)</p><p>This is entirely analogous to the treatment of the chemical interaction energies V;; treated in Chapter 7. Negative values of Jj,; correspond to ferromagnetism while positive values correspond to anti-ferromagnetism. Positive values of Mj; imply that the strength of the ferro-magnetic coupling between unlike atoms is stronger than between like atoms. Most treatments do not consider magnetic interactions beyond the nearest-neighbour coordination shell.</p><p>The most convenient way of determining the interchange energies is from experimental values of the critical ordering temperature, which is designated the Curie temperature for ferromagnetic ordering The Curie temperature for alloys with two magnetic components having the same spin (1/2 or 1) can be written as follows:</p><p>T= pTBwe = i (1) (1) Mo Me) { Shs [a = 2) 244 5 288 (4 2) 42 “| (8.9)</p><p>a(1— 2) + Bx k k k  =========== 236 N. Saunders and A. P. Miodownik</p><p>In this equation, 2 is the magnetic analogue to the x factor used in the chemical ordering case to compensate for the higher critical temperatures always generated by the BWG formalism (see Chapter 7). Comparing the results from the BWG treatment with those of other more sophisticated treatments leads to a value of ps = 0.8 (Inden 1975) and the long-range ordering parameter 77 takes values between 0 and 1 as in the case of chemical ordering. In the magnetic case 7 equals the ratio of the mean spin value per atom at temperature T to the maximum value of s (at 0 K). K, is a parameter which varies with the magnitude of the magnetic spin s such that K, = 1 for s = 1/2 and K, = 2/3 for s = 1. The coefficients a and ( can be set either to 0 or | to cover various combinations of magnetic and non-magnetic components.</p><p>8.3.2 Empirical derivation</p><p>Given that S™% can be described using Eq.

Miodownik (1977) assumed that T* = 0.97, for Fe, Co, Ni and their alloys. It then follows that</p><p>H™€ = 0.9T, log.(fo + 1). (8.11) Weiss and Tauer (1958) made the alternative assumption that HE’ = RTs. (8.12)</p><p>Such equations have the advantage of simplicity but comparison with Eq. (8.2) implies that ¢ is totally independent of s and z. Whichever expression is used, the next step is to incorporate the effect of temperature on the alignment of the magnetic spins. In view of the other simplifications which have already been adopted, this can be achieved (Miodownik 1977, 1978) by approximating the Brillouin-Langevin formalism for the number of aligned spins (87) remaining at T &lt; 0.97, through the following expression:</p><p>BT = Bll -7] (8.13)</p><p>where r defines the ratio (7&#39;/T,).

DERIVATION OF MAGNETIC GIBBS ENERGY</p><p>Even if magnetic interaction energies are available to define a magnetic enthalpy, the development of a viable Gibbs energy expression is difficult. As already noted in the preceding section, the expressions for the magnetic entropy in a BWG treat- ment become increasingly complicated when s &gt; 1/2 and, indeed, may become inexact if the distribution of individual spins is not known. In practice their application also requires a series of nested Gibbs energy minimisation calculations which become costly in computing time. Also, of course, the BWG approximation does not take into account any short-range order except through empirical corrections.</p><p>Despite these drawbacks remarkably good results have been obtained in the equi- atomic region of the Fe-Co system (Inden 1977) which are virtually indistinguish- able from those obtained by CVM calculations (Colinet 1993). However, this  =========== 238 N. Saunders and A. P. Miodownik</p><p>region deals only with A2/B2 equilibria where the BWG method is known to work well. It is otherwise inadequate to deal with f.c.c.—b.c.c. equilibria, notably in pure Fe or Fe-rich alloys, because of the very small differences in the free energies of the f.c.c. and b.c.c. allotropes. In such cases it is vitally important to include short-range magnetic order and find alternative means of defining the magnetic Gibbs energy.</p><p>8.4.1 General algorithms for the magnetic Gibbs energy</p><p>With expressions for the magnetic enthalpy and entropy it is now possible to build up an algorithm for G™* at any temperature.

Therefore, most alternative expressions have been based on approximate analytical expressions for the magnetic specific heat. However, all such expressions also incorporate the functions log,(@ + 1) and 7 and are a far cry from the original methods of graphical integration.</p><p>8.4.3 Magnetic Gibbs energy as a function of CT for ferromagnetic systems</p><p>8.4.3.1 The model of Inden. This approach was pioneered by Inden (1976) who developed the following empirical equations:</p><p>References are listed on pp. 256-258.  =========== CALPHAD—A Comprehensive Guide 239 fort &lt;1 cmt = K&#39;?Rlog,(1 +7°)/log.(1 — 7°) (8.20a) for7 &gt;1 cm® = K*?Rlog,(1 +7°)/log.(1 ~ 7°) (8.20b)</p><p>where K&#39;? and K<em>&quot;° are empirically derived coefficients. At first sight these equations appear to differ substantially from Eq. (8.19), but the values of K&#39; tro and K</em>° are constrained by the need to correctly reproduce both the total entropy and take into account experimental values of ¢. Since the total entropy is an explicit function of {, the net result is that this treatment also has a mixed dependence on the two key magnetic parameters 6 and T,. Further, a relationship between K&quot;? and K&quot;&#39; can be obtained by considering Hieg:</p><p>K* = 518/675(K&quot; + 0.6K”) = log,(3 + 1) (8.21) K&#39;° = 474/497((1 — ¢)/4]K&quot;. (8.22)</p><p>A dependence on crystallographic parameters is introduced through making ¢ a function of z, as already indicated in Section 8.1.3. Introducing fixed values of ¢ appropriate to each crystal structure is a useful simplification as it is then possible to uniquely define the values of K&quot;° and K*° (de Fontaine et al. 1995).</p><p>8.4.3.2 Model of Hillert and Jarl. In his original treatment, Inden (1976) used a complicated but closed expression for the enthalpy, but had to use a series expansion in order to calculate the entropy. Hillert and Jarl (1978) therefore decided to convert the C, expression directly through a series expansion which substantially simplifies the overall calculation and leads to a maximum error of only 1-2 J/mol at the Curie temperature of Fe. The equivalent equations to those used by Inden (1976) are given by</p><p>forr &lt;1 cms = 2K R(r™ 447m 4 1 sm) (8.23a) forr&gt;1 CR = DKR(r +37 4 By), (8.23b) 8.4.3.3 Alternative C, models.

Miodownik</p><p>8.4.3.4 Comparison of models for the ferromagnetic Gibbs energy. It is difficult to compare the various treatments described in Sections 8.4.3.1 to 8.4.3.3, because simultaneous changes were made in both the models and input parameters during their formulation. This is a perennial problem if different weightings are attached to magnetic and thermodynamic data (de Fontaine et al. 1995). The suggestion by Inden (1976) that values for m and n in Eqs (18.18a) and (18.18b) should be taken as 3 and 5 respectively has been preserved by Hillert and Jarl (1978). This is still the core assumption as far as 3d elements are concerned in current models. However, it may be necessary to relax this assumption in systems with larger magnetic spin numbers (de Fontaine et al. 1995)</p><p>8.4.4 Anti-ferromagnetic and ferri-magnetic systems</p><p>Providing there is no change in value of J with temperature, Eq. (8.4) can also be used to determine the maximum magnetic entropy in anti-ferromagnetic and ferri- magnetic materials (Miodownik 1978a, Smith 1967, Hofmann et al. 1956). A comparison of predicted and experimental magnetic entropies and energies (Table 8.1) indicates that this is a reasonable assumption in most cases. If serious discrepancies remain between theoretical expectations and experimental results, it may be necessary to consider the existence of multiple magnetic states (see Section 8.7).</p><p>8.5.

With the assumption that 6Tc/6z is a constant, it is then possible to write:</p><p>GU (T) = GRE(T) - “(= spot (8.25)</p><p>where T = T, — 2(6T/5z). The Zener method therefore depends totally on the assumption of a linear variation of 57,/6x and any associated changes in § are reflected in the change of T,. It can, nevertheless, give reasonable results for dilute solutions and was extensively used by Hillert et al. (1967) in the period before the Inden formulation was more generally adopted in Europe. It, however, remained popular in Japan for the characterisation of Fe alloys, which was its original field of application (Nishizawa et al. 1979, Hasebe et al. 1985).</p><p>Zener’s method does not explicitly take into account the effect of changes in 8 with composition but implicitly assumes that any changes in f are reflected in the changes in T,. Clougherty and Kaufman (1963) considered how changes in ( with composition might affect the terminal magnetic entropy of f.c.c. Ni-Zn alloys, but this did not lead to a generalised approach which was applicable across the whole system. Miodownik (1977) showed that values of T, and @ for alloys could be intro- duced into the same algorithm developed for the elements, but this was superseded by the advent of the Hillert~Jarl formalism. With the need to handle multi-component calculations it was then a natural step to develop (separate) Redlich-Kister polynomials for the variation of 8 and T, with composition (Chin et al. 1987).</p><p>8.5.2 Systems whose end-members exhibit different forms of magnetism</p><p>8.5.2.1 Ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic transition. When end-members exhibit different forms of magnetism there are often significant deviations from linearity in both T, and ( and these parameters may become zero in the middle of the system. One example is associated with a change from ferromagnetic to anti- ferromagnetic behaviour which occurs in a number of industrially important systems, such as Fe-Ni (Fig. 8.4(a)) and the related ternary system Fe-Ni-Mn (Fig. 8.4(b)). b.c.c. Fe-Cr, rare-earth and oxide systems can also exhibit similar complexity. In such situations special measures need to be taken to allow a Redlich-Kister-type polynomial to be used to describe J, and f. Since ferromagnetism and anti-ferromagnetism are associated with values for Jj; of opposite sign, Weiss and Tauer (1956) suggested that a continuous change between these two forms of magnetic ordering could best be described by attaching a negative sign to Neel temperatures. These authors also suggested a semi-empirical  =========== 242 N. Saunders and A. P.

(8.26)</p><p>Here the two parameters, ZT and Z|, refer to the relative number of spins of opposite sign, which allows this equation to be used for both ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic materials. One implication of Eq. (8.26) is that, for a given value of @ and type of magnetism, the critical temperature is expected to be higher for f.c.c, materials than for b.c.c. materials, which accounts for the observation that T° &gt; TF although B© &lt; AF*. There are, however, problems when applying this simple empirical equation to anti-ferromagnetic BCC materials such as Cr and to structures with lower symmetry.</p><p>A more important conclusion of Eq. (8.26) is that, for a given value of @ in an f.c.c. lattice, the value of T,, derived for an anti-ferromagnetic alloy will be 1/3 of the equivalent value of T, in the ferromagnetic case. The utility of this approach has been verified by Chin et al. (1987) who, in order to optimise parameters for their Redlich-Kister polynomials for the critical temperatures of various binary alloy systems, converted positive values of T,, to negative values of T, and were able to reproduce the critical temperature variation arising from the ferromagnetic/anti- ferromagnetic transition. These authors also used the same convention to differentiate ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic values of § when adapting the Hillert-Jarl formalism into Thermo-Calc, although this must be considered purely as a mathematical convenience and has no theoretical justification.</p><p>Another simplification that has been made with respect to the implementation of magnetic algorithms into software packages, such as Thermo-Calc, relates to the composition at which T, and ( reach zero. One might expect that this would happen at one particular composition but Figs. 8.4(a) and (b) show that the situation may be much more complicated. In order to be consistent with a simplified magnetic model Chin et al. (1987) chose a set of parameters which effectively smoothed out the differences in the two critical compositions for binary alloys. This however pre- cludes a proper prediction of regions of mixed magnetism, which is important in Invar alloys (Miodownik 1978b) as well as making it impossible to reproduce effects such as shown in Figs. 8.4(a) and (b).</p><p>8.5.2.2 Ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition. In other cases, a zero T, may be associated with the transition between ferromagnetism and paramagnetism. Even the use of higher-order Redlich—Kister polynomials cannot properly reproduce such a sudden change in slope and some smoothing of the measured variation of T, and B has to be accepted in the vicinity of 0 K. As both enthalpy and entropy contribu- tions scale approximately with T,, at low temperatures, this will only lead to small errors on the overall Gibbs energy at such compositions. However, under certain circumstances spurious miscibility gaps have been predicted at high temperatures  =========== 244 N. Saunders and A. P. Miodownik</p><p>in systems that exhibit abrupt changes in T, with composition (Inden 1981). Care has, therefore, to be taken in deriving the input parameters to the Hillert—Jarl formalism in such cases. The fact remains that such miscibility gaps have never been observed in practice and it may, therefore, be that as T, approaches zero some other effects, such as itinerant ferromagnetism (Wohlfarth 1974), may occur which essentially smooth out the variation of magnetic entropy. In this instance, the Redlich—-Kister formalism may actually be a better approximation to reality than would be indicated by trying to reproduce a T, or T, obtained by linear extrap- olation of experimental results to 0 K.</p><p>8.6. THE ESTIMATION OF MAGNETIC PARAMETERS</p><p>8.6.1 Magnetic versus thermochemical approaches to evaluating the magnetic Gibbs energy</p><p>In principle, the value of Gr should be the same whether it is derived from knowledge of ( or from the magnetic specific heat. Since the latter is derived by subtraction of other major terms from the total specific heat, such an agreement is a useful confirmation that the deconvolution process has been properly conducted. However, this is not always achieved. In some studies, e.g., for Cr (Andersson 1985), Co (Fernandez-Guillermet 1987) and Ni (Dinsdale 1991), the listed 6 values are ‘effective thermochemical moments’ which have been derived on the basis of a global thermochemical assessment rather than from magnetic measurements. Small differences will always arise when considering ways of averaging data and truncating series, but one should be cautious of a tendency for f to become an adjustable parameter. Such discrepancies will hopefully be reduced in the future by the incorporation of better magnetic models (de Fontaine et al. 1995).</p><p>8.6.2 Values of the saturation magnetisation, B</p><p>It should be emphasised that it is the rule rather than the exception for to change markedly with crystal structure (Table 8.2). It is therefore unwise to assume that various metastable allotropes can be given the same value of 6 as for the stable structure. In some cases values of @ can be extrapolated from stable or metastable alloys with the requisite crystal structure, but in others this is not possible. A significant development is that it is now possible to include spin polarisation in electron energy calculations (Moruzzi and Marcus 1988, 1990a,b, Asada and Terakura 1995). This allows a calculation of the equilibrium value of to be made in any desired crystal structure. More importantly, such values are in good accord with known values for equilibrium phases (Table 8.2). It has also been shown that magnetic orbital contributions play a relatively minor role (Eriksson et al. 1990), so calculated values of 9 for metastable phases should be reasonably reliable.</p><p>References are listed on pp. 256-258.  =========== CALPHAD—A Comprehensive Guide 245</p><p>Table 8.2.

Some of these differences can be rationalised by the occurrence of mixed magnetic states resulting from increasing temperatures, as most of the data in Table 8.2 essentially refers to 0 K. This is almost certainly the case for Cr and Mn (Weiss 1972, 1979, Moruzzi and Marcus 1990a, b). In the case of Co, the c.p.h. form, é-Co, is a close competitor to the f.c.c. form, a-Co, near the Curie temperature. High stacking-fault densities may therefore also lead to unusual effects (Miodownik 1977). In the case of a-Mn, there is documented evidence for a considerable decrease in 9 on passing through T;, which could be associated with a transition from an anti-ferromagnetic to a ‘non-magnetic state’ (Gazzara et al. 1964, Weiss 1979). Nevertheless, a single temperature-independent value of @ seems a useful starting point in the majority of cases, especially when no other data is available to predict values for metastable elements and solutions. It is noted that @ is very sensitive to atomic volume (Moruzzi and Marcus 1990a,b) which is certainly one of the reasons for the non- linearity observed for the variation of @ even in simple solid solutions.</p><p>8.7. MULTIPLE MAGNETIC STATES,</p><p>It is not generally appreciated that there are many competing forms of magnetic ordering. When one particular magnetic ground state is substantially more stable than other alternatives, the conventional disordering of magnetic spins, as described in the previous sections, is the only scenario which needs to be considered. However, additional excitations at high temperatures can arise if another magnetic configuration with a comparable ground-state energy exists. Such a hypothesis was used to explain a number of anomalous experimental results in the case of metastable phases in various Fe, Ni and Co alloys and particularly in the case of Invar alloys (Weiss 1963, Chikazumi and Matsui 1978). Together with the switch from ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic behaviour (Fig. 8.4) this makes com- pelling experimental evidence for the co-existence of two magnetic states in Fe-Ni and Fe-Co alloys (Miodownik 1978b). Weiss (1979) later extended this concept to other 3d elements.</p><p>8.7.1 Treatments of multiple states The simplest way to describe the equilibrium between various competing states is to use a Shottky model (Weiss 1963) where</p><p>a= = 2 exp (—AE/RT). (8.27) fn on</p><p>Here a is the ratio of the fraction of atoms, f, corresponding to the two magnetic</p><p>References are listed on pp. 256-258.  =========== CALPHAD—A Comprehensive Guide 247</p><p>states, y, and -y2, and g; and g» are the corresponding degeneracies of the two states. Clearly if AF (the difference in energy between the two states) is large and/or the temperature is low, there is effectively only one state and one magnetic moment. However, as AE becomes smaller there can be changes in the effective magnetic moment, especially in the case of 7-Fe. Here the two states correspond to a ferromagnetic moment of ~ 2.8jB and an anti-ferromagnetic moment of = 0.5 uB, which leads to the effective moment being given by</p><p>BR* = [2.8/(1 +a) + 0.5a/(1 +0). (8.28)</p><p>This contrasts with the assumption made in virtually all other magnetic models that the value of is independent of temperature. Several variants of the Shottky model have been developed by Miodownik (1977, 1978a) to take into account the situa- tion where one of the two states subsequently undergoes magnetic ordering (Fig. 8.5). In such cases it may also be necessary to consider a temperature-dependent AE (Miodownik and Hillert 1980).</p><p>8.7.2 Thermodynamic consequences of multiple states</p><p>One of the consequences of accepting the presence of multiple magnetic states is an additional contribution to the entropy and, therefore, several authors have con- sidered the inclusion of multiple states in their description of low-temperature phase transformations in Fe and its alloys (Kaufman et al. 1963, Miodownik 1970, Bendick and Pepperhoff 1978). However, most authors have, in the end, preferred to describe the magnetic effects in Fe using more conventional temperature- independent values for the magnetic moments of the relevant phases. This is partly linked to the absence of any provision for the necessary formalism in current</p><p>WEISS HILLERT CHIKAZUMI PEPPERHOFF</p><p>Figure 8.5.

It has therefore been suggested (de Fontaine et al. 1995) that future developments should make provision for the inclusion of multiple states. While having only a marginal effect on AG at high temperatures (Fig. 8.7a) such a model would lead to significant changes in the driving force for low-temperature (martensitic) transfor- mations and, more importantly, should lead to better modelling of many associated changes in physical properties (Bendick and Pepperhoff 1978, Bendick et al. 1977).</p><p>8.8.

An interesting recent example is given by the Fe-Co—Zn system as the latter two elements have opposite effects on the Curie temperature of Fe (Takayama et al. 1995). In some early diagrams, such abrupt changes were inexplicable and deemed to be due to ‘experimental error’.</p><p>Distortion of miscibility gaps.

Here, too, the apparent presence of more than one maximum in a miscibility gap was believed to represent experi- mental error before it was shown to have a sound theoretical foundation.</p><p>Continuous transition between first- and second-order transformations. When examined more closely, the Nishizawa Hom represents a situation where there is a continuous transition between a first- and second-order transformation. This remarkable situation is not restricted to systems which exhibit a miscibility gap (Inden 1981a) (Fig. 8.10), and it therefore remains to be seen whether it is possible to maintain a hard and fast distinction between these two types of transformation  =========== 250 N.

Because of the location of the Curie temperature in pure Fe, the effect of magnetic forces on the A3 is much more pronounced than on the A4 and alloying additions can produce asymmetric effects on the two transitions (Zener 1955, Miodownik 1977, 1978a, b). Interestingly, although the Curie temperature of Co is much higher, the value of Gigg-eP is not as affected because the magnetic properties of both phases are similar (Miodownik 1977). However, because S&#39;°<em>-¢P&gt; js also small, the allotropic transition temperature can be substantially reduced (Fig. 8.11). Magnetic effects on metastable transformations, The underlying factor in all the above effects is the magnitude of the ratio (G™8/G&#39;</em>) and especially its variation with temperature. It follows that there can also be a substantial effect on the driving force for phase transformations, including shear transformations. Thus the martensite start temperature, M7~*, in most Fe alloys is dominated by the  =========== 252 N. Saunders and A. P.

The effect has been confirmed by many experiments and an external magnetic field can destabilise austenite during martensitic transformations, causing a rise in Ms temperature of approximately 3°K Tesla“! (Sadovskiy et al. 1961, Fields and Graham 1976). This effect turns out to be directly proportional to the difference in entropy between the two phases (Satyanarayan ef al. 1972). A magnetic field can also markedly alter the rate of transformation in isothermal martensite reactions (Peters et al, 1972, Kakeshita et al. 1993). While changes in Mg due to deformation are well known, the presence of high magnetic fields generated by superconductors at cryogenic temperatures can produce similar effects. Diffusion-controlled transformations are also prone to magnetic-field effects as the driving force for transformation is affected. Thus Fe—-Co alloys can be converted from 100% austenite to 100% ferrite at elevated temperatures (Fig. 8.13) under the influence of a field generated by a conventional bench magnet (Peters and Miodownik 1973). The expansion of a miscibility gap and the precipitation of the o phase in Fe~Cr alloys (Chen et al. 1983) are another example of effects that can be induced by an extemal field.</p><p>Although a magnetic field is not commonly applied, it has certain advantages in allowing a precise increment of Gibbs energy to be added instantaneously to a</p><p>1270</p><p>1260</p><p>°K</p><p>H=0 1250 H=2 Tesla</p><p>1240</p><p>0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 Mole fraction Co.</p><p>Figure 8.13.
