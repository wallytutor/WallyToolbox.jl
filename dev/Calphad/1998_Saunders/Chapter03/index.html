INTRODUCTION</a><a id="3.1.-INTRODUCTION-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#3.1.-INTRODUCTION" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Thermodynamics is the science which underpins the CALPHAD method. Although the practice of calculating phase diagrams is computer intensive and relies heavily on mathematical manipulation, it would not be possible to begin without model descriptions of the underlying thermodynamics of the system of interest. A further strength of thermodynamics is that the underlying principles and laws are applicable to any type of system and hence the CALPHAD approach can be used equally well in many disciplines, for example geology, chemical and process engineering, materials science and nuclear technology; the list is very long.</p><p>The aim of this chapter is not to go into great depth on this subject but to introduce the reader to the key concepts which will be discussed later in the book. The chapter begins by describing the first and second laws of thermodynamics and introducing the reader to the ideas of enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs energy. There will be examples of how Gibbs energy can be used to indicate the direction of a chemical reaction and how heat evolution can be predicted. The concept of Gibbs energy will then be applied to solution phases, for example liquids, and the concept of partial quantities introduced. The reader will then be introduced to the calculation of phase diagrams using a series of quite simple examples.</p><h2 id="3.2.-THE-FIRST-LAW-OF-THERMODYNAMICS"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#3.2.-THE-FIRST-LAW-OF-THERMODYNAMICS">3.2. THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS</a><a id="3.2.-THE-FIRST-LAW-OF-THERMODYNAMICS-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#3.2.-THE-FIRST-LAW-OF-THERMODYNAMICS" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Thermodynamics is concerned with energy and the way energy is transferred. It is a science of the macroscopic world but its effects are applied even at the microscopic scale. The first law introduces the basic thermodynamic concepts of work, heat and energy and can be defined as follows: Energy can neither be created or destroyed in a system of constant mass, although it may be converted from one form to another.</p><p>This law is also called the Law of Conservation of Energy. The diagram below (Fig. 3.1), after Mackowiak (1966), represents a system of constant mass and energy which is enclosed in the circle. The arrows represent the interconvertability of the various types of energy. For example, heat energy can be converted to mechanical work, which is the basis of internal combustion engines.</p><p>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;figures/fig-3.1.png&quot; alt&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A closed system of constant mass and energy showing the interconvertability of various forms of energy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p><p>If external energy is supplied to the system it must absorb the energy either by increasing its own internal energy and/or by doing work. As energy can neither be created or destroyed, the following relationship is obtained:</p><p class="math-container">\[\Delta{}U = q - w \quad\text{(3.1)}\]</p><p>where \(\Delta{}U\) is the change in internal energy (defined as the sum of all the kinetic energies and energies of interaction of the particles in the system), \(q\) is the heat (or energy) supplied and \(w\) is the work done by the system. Some of the fundamental equations of thermodynamics will now be derived.</p><h3 id="3.2.1-The-definition-of-enthalpy-and-heat-capacity"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#3.2.1-The-definition-of-enthalpy-and-heat-capacity">3.2.1 The definition of enthalpy and heat capacity</a><a id="3.2.1-The-definition-of-enthalpy-and-heat-capacity-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#3.2.1-The-definition-of-enthalpy-and-heat-capacity" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>If \(q_{p}\) joules of energy are introduced to a gas confined in a cylinder at pressure \(p\) (Fig. 3.2(a)), the internal energy of the gas increases and to maintain the pressure at a constant \(p\) the gas expands (Fig. 3.2(b)).</p><p>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;figures/fig-3.2.png&quot; alt&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p><p>To keep the pressure constant, the gas has done work by pushing the piston during expansion and this work is given by</p><p class="math-container">\[w = p\Delta{}v \quad\text{(3.2)}\]</p><p>where \(\Delta{}v\) is the change in volume of the gas. Substituting into Eq. (3.1) gives</p><p class="math-container">\[\Delta{}U = q\_{p} - p\Delta{}v \quad\text{(3.3)}\]</p><p>or, alternatively</p><p class="math-container">\[\Delta(U + pu) = q\_{p} \quad\text{(3.4)}\]</p><p>The term on the left-hand side \((U + pv)\) is very important in thermodynamics and is called the <em>enthalpy</em>. It is given the symbol \(H\). Thus by definition</p><p class="math-container">\[\Delta{}H = q\_{p} \quad\text{(3.5)}\]</p><p>An increase in enthalpy therefore denotes the heat absorbed during a process at constant pressure. For the case of constant volume the process is simpler as the system does no work on its surroundings, i.e., \(p\Delta{}v = 0\). Therefore,</p><p class="math-container">\[\Delta{}U = q\_{v} \quad\text{(3.6)}\]</p><p>where \(q_{v}\) is the heat absorbed by the system with constant volume. The heat capacity of a system, \(C\), can now be defined as the quantity of heat necessary to raise a system by a temperature, \(\delta{}T\), and can be expressed as a differential</p><p class="math-container">\[C = \frac{dq}{dT} \quad\text{(3.7)}\]</p><p>\(C\) is temperature dependent and is often described using an empirical formula such as</p><p class="math-container">\[C = a + bT + cT^{-1} + dT^{-2} \quad\text{(3.8)}\]</p><p>Equation (3.7) is true for heat capacities at either constant pressure or constant volume. However, the heat capacity will be different if the system is at constant pressure (\(C_{p}\)) or constant volume (\(C_{v}\)). For the case of constant pressure, combining Eqs (3.5) and (3.7) gives</p><p class="math-container">\[C\_{p} = \frac{dH}{dT} \quad\text{(3.9)}\]</p><p>and for the case of constant volume, combining Eqs (3.6) and (3.7) gives</p><p class="math-container">\[C\_{v} = \frac{dU}{dT} \quad\text{(3.10)}\]</p><h3 id="3.2.2-Enthalpy-of-formation"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#3.2.2-Enthalpy-of-formation">3.2.2 Enthalpy of formation</a><a id="3.2.2-Enthalpy-of-formation-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#3.2.2-Enthalpy-of-formation" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>The enthalpy of formation is defined as the heat evolved or absorbed when an alloy or compound is formed from its elements. For example, in the formation of \(CO_{2}\)</p><p class="math-container">\[C\_{(s)} + O\_{2(g)} \leftrightarrow CO\_{2(g)}\quad\text{(3.11)}\]</p><p>there is an evolution of heat and such a reaction is termed <em>exothermic</em>. In this circumstance the enthalpy of formation is then a negative quantity. Conversely, during the reaction</p><p class="math-container">\[C\_{(s)} + CO\_{2(g)} \leftrightarrow 2CO\_{(g)}\quad\text{(3.12)}\]</p><p>heat is absorbed and in this circumstance the reaction is <em>endothermic</em>. The enthalpy of formation is then a positive quantity.</p><h3 id="3.2.3-Hess&#39;s-law"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#3.2.3-Hess&#39;s-law">3.2.3 Hess&#39;s law</a><a id="3.2.3-Hess&#39;s-law-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#3.2.3-Hess&#39;s-law" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>The enthalpy of formation or reaction can be either measured directly or calculated using Hess&#39;s law. This states that the overall change in the enthalpy of a chemical reaction is the same whether it takes place in one step or in several steps. Therefore</p><p class="math-container">\[\Delta{}H = \Delta{}H\_{1} + \Delta{}H\_{2} + \Delta{}H\_{3} + ... + \Delta{}H\_{n} \quad\text{(3.13)}\]</p><p>where \(\Delta{}H_{1,2,3,...,n}\) are the individual enthalpy changes which take place at each of the steps. This can be used to calculate a heat of reaction in the following way. Suppose that \(a\) moles of reactant \(A\) and \(b\) moles of \(B\) react as follows:</p><p class="math-container">\[aA + bB + \Delta{}H^{\circ} \rightarrow cC + dD \quad\text{(3.14)}\]</p><p>The heat absorbed/evolved, \(\Delta{}H^{\circ}\), during the reaction is given by</p><p class="math-container">\[a\Delta{}H\_{A} + b\Delta{}H\_{B} + \Delta{}H^{\circ} = c\Delta{}H\_{C} + d\Delta{}H\_{D} \quad\text{(3.15)}\]</p><p>\(\Delta{}H^{\circ}\) is then found if \(\Delta{}H_{A,B,C,D}\) are known. \(\Delta{}H\) is not temperature independent and Kirchhoff&#39;s law can be used to define how \(\Delta{}H\) varies with temperature.</p><h3 id="3.2.4-Kirchhoff&#39;s-law"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#3.2.4-Kirchhoff&#39;s-law">3.2.4 Kirchhoff&#39;s law</a><a id="3.2.4-Kirchhoff&#39;s-law-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#3.2.4-Kirchhoff&#39;s-law" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Figure 3.3 shows how to determine the enthalpy change \(\Delta{}H_{2}\) at \(T_{2}\) starting with a knowledge of a chemical reaction at temperature \(T_{1}\); whose enthalpy change is \(\Delta{}H_{1}\).</p><p>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;figures/fig-3.3.png&quot; alt&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p><p>By first reacting \(x\) and \(y\) at \(T_{1}\); and then raising the temperature of the products from \(T_{1}\) to \(T_{2}\), i.e., along \(ABC\), the heat absorbed/evolved in the process will be</p><p class="math-container">\[\Delta{}H\_{1} + \int_{T\_{1}}^{T\_{2}}C\_{p,(z)}dT \quad\text{(3.16)}\]</p><p>The second way of obtaining the same result is to raise the temperature from \(T_{1}\) to \(T_{2}\) and then reacting \(x\) and \(y\) at \(T_{2}\), i.e., along \(DC\).

(3.17) and, therefore,</p><p class="math-container">\[\int\_{T\_{1}}^{T\_{2}}\left(C\_{p,(x)}+C\_{p,(y)}\right)dT + \Delta{}H\_{2} = \Delta{}H\_{1} + \int\_{T\_{1}}^{T\_{2}}C\_{p,(z)}dT \quad\text{(3.18)}\]</p><p>which gives</p><p class="math-container">\[\Delta{}H\_{2} - \Delta{}H\_{1} = \int\_{T\_{1}}^{T\_{2}} \left[C\_{p,(z)} - \left(C\_{p,(x)}+C\_{p,(y)}\right)\right]dT \quad\text{(3.19)}\]</p><p>with</p><p class="math-container">\[\Delta{}C\_{p} = C\_{p,(z)} - \left(C\_{p,(x)}+C\_{p,(y)}\right) \quad\text{(3.20)}\]</p><p>where \(\Delta{}C_{p}\), is the difference between heat capacity of product and reactants.

THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS</a><a id="3.3.-THE-SECOND-LAW-OF-THERMODYNAMICS-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#3.3.-THE-SECOND-LAW-OF-THERMODYNAMICS" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>The second law of thermodynamics plays a vital part in any reaction, whether this is a simple combustion process or a complex phase transformation in a steel. The first law of thermodynamics considered the heat/work/energy involved in reactions, but this is not sufficient to decide whether a reaction will proceed in any given direction; it is the so-called &#39;free energy&#39; of a reaction whose sign is crucial.</p><p>Take a reversible cycle in a system where \(p\), \(v\), \(T\), etc., change so slowly that the system passes through a series of small, equilibrium, isothermal steps before arriving back to its initial position. Let \(\delta{}q_{a}\) be the heat absorbed during one of these steps when the temperature is \(T_{a}\). It is found experimentally that the sum of \(\frac{\delta{}q_{a}}{T_{a}}\) for all of the various steps taken during the cycle is equal to zero, i.e.,</p><p class="math-container">\[\sum\frac{\delta{}q}{T} = 0 \quad\text{(3.22)}\]</p><p>thus \(\frac{\delta{}q}{T}\) is a state function. This means that the value of \(\frac{\delta{}q}{T}\) depends on the state of the system rather than its history, i.e., its value is independent of the path taken. The name entropy was given to the quantity \(\frac{\delta{}q}{T}\) which was given the symbol \(\Delta{}S\). It was found that the entropy of a closed system can only increase (in an irreversible reaction) or stay constant (in equilibrium). This is the second law of thermodynamics.</p><p>The function which decides whether a process will occur is the free energy change, \(\Delta{}G\), where</p><p class="math-container">\[\Delta{}G=\Delta{}U + p\Delta{}v - T\Delta{}S \quad\text{(3.23)}\]</p><p>and for a reaction to proceed \(\Delta{}G\) must be negative. For a process at constant pressure Eq. (3.23) is written as</p><p class="math-container">\[\Delta{}G=\Delta{}H - T\Delta{}S \quad\text{(3.24a)}\]</p><p>and \(\Delta{}G\) is known as the Gibbs energy change of the process. At constant volume (\(\Delta{}v=0\)) Eq. (3.23) becomes</p><p class="math-container">\[\Delta{}F=\Delta{}U - T\Delta{}S \quad\text{(3.24b)}\]</p><p>where \(\Delta{}F\) is called the Helmholtz energy.</p><h3 id="3.3.1-The-Gibbs-Helmholtz-equation"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#3.3.1-The-Gibbs-Helmholtz-equation">3.3.1 The Gibbs-Helmholtz equation</a><a id="3.3.1-The-Gibbs-Helmholtz-equation-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#3.3.1-The-Gibbs-Helmholtz-equation" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>The Gibbs-Helmholtz equation (Eq.

Kelvin and Boltzmann recognised that there was a relationship between entropy and probability (cf., disorder) of a system with the entropy given by</p><p class="math-container">\[S=k\ln(W)\quad\text{(3.33)}\]</p><p>where \(k\) is Boltzmann&#39;s constant and \(W\) is a measure of the disorder of a system. This means the maximum entropy is associated with the greatest disorder. The consequences of this can be understood by considering a condensed and gaseous phase. The gas has a very high degree of disorder compared to a condensed phase, hence (1) it will absorb more heat and (2) it will become stabilised as the temperature is increased.

This led to a definition for the third law of thermodynamics that at a temperature of absolute zero the entropy of a condensed system would also be zero. This was further refined by Planck (1911) who suggested this be reworded as the entropy of a pure element or substance in a perfect crystalline form is zero at absolute zero.</p><p>This law is particularly useful as it allows the total entropy of a substance to be obtained if sufficiently low-temperature enthalpy or heat-capacity measurements are available.

However, if it could form a mixture of two phases, one with composition z/,, and the other with composition Toys it could lower its total Gibbs energy to G&#39;, where G&#39; is defined by the equation</p><p>zo — zi, zl — 29 = ag Om tg Om (3.62)</p><p>‘a a ~ Tay and Gi, and Gj, are respectively the Gibbs energies of a at composition z/,, and</p><p>“a further separation to compositions 14, and x4, sees a further reduction of the Gibbs energy of the two-phase mixture to G”. This process can continue but is limited to a critical point where the compositions correspond to ae and aE where any further fluctuation in the compositions of the two phases causes the Gibbs energy of the mixture to rise. This point is then a critical position and the phases ay</p><p>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;figures/placeholder.png&quot; alt&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3.11. G/x diagram at 600 K for A-B system shown in Fig. 3.10(a) showing separation of a single-phase structure into a mixture of two phases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p><p>and a2 with compositions ae and ae respectively are defined as being in equilibrium with each other. At this point it is convenient to define the fraction of each phase using the equation</p><p>aE — a9 No, = —2-— (3.63a) wae a8, and _ gE Noy = =o au (3.63b)</p><p>m3 ah where NE and NE are the number of moles of a and a respectively.</p><p>This critical position of equilibrium can be defined in two fundamentally different ways. The first is that the system A-B with composition 2 has reached an equilibrium where its Gibbs energy is at a minimum. The second definition is that phases a and a2 with compositions 2% and z® are in equilibrium because the chemical potentials of A and B are equal in both phases. The importance of these two definitions becomes clearer if we consider how it would be possible to write a computer programme to find z® and 2.</p><p>One method would be to use Eq. (3.62) and utilise a Newton-Raphson technique to perform a Gibbs energy minimisation with respect to the composition of either A or B. This has an advantage in that only the integral function need be calculated and it is therefore mathematically simpler. The other is to minimise the difference in potential of A and B in the two phases using the relationships</p><p>4 = 64+ (1-24) a4</p><p>A oa (3.64) dz4 and 6% = 63 + (1-29) a SB (3.65) B B ‘B, azz, i.</p><p>This has added mathematical complexity but it can be a very sensitive parameter for convergence which can be achieved quite rapidly. The calculation of the phase diagram is then achieved by calculating phase equilibria at various temperatures below 900 K and plotting the phase boundaries for each temperature.</p><p>When the points in Fig. 3.12 are joined by a line-fitting routine this yields the phase diagram shown in Fig. 3.10(a). In the more general case there is usually equilibria between crystallographically distinct phases. In this case it is necessary to define some reference states. So far only the case of Gibbs energy of mixing has been considered for solution phases. However, when two or more crystal- lographically distinct phases are considered, the Gibbs energy at the ‘end-points&#39; of the mixing curve must be considered. Perhaps the easiest way to consider this is to</p><p>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;figures/placeholder.png&quot; alt&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3.12. Calculated phase diagram of an AB system with a miscibility gap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p><p>take a calculation of phase equilibria for Ni~Cu between 1000-1500 K where there are two phases, f.c.c. and liquid, which form continuous solutions between Cu and Ni.</p><p>To describe the Gibbs energy of this system, the Gibbs energy of Cu and Ni must be described in both the liquid and solid states. This means we must add the reference states for the liquid and f.c.c. phases in pure Cu and Ni, to the mixing energies of the liquid and f.c.c. phases. The Gibbs energy is then described by the general formula</p><p>G = Geet + GS, + Gidea! (3.66)</p><p>where Gide! is given by Eq. (3.51). Gyer is then a simple linear extrapolation of the Gibbs energies of the liquid and f.c.c. phases using the equations</p><p>GIG® = tou GE + ami GEE* (3.67)</p><p>and</p><p>GI = requ GQ + ami GM (3.68)</p><p>where GEES, and CE are the Gibbs energies of the f.c.c. and liquid phases in pure Cu and Ni respectively. More generally the reference and ideal mixing terms may be written as</p><p>Gret = ya G (3.69)</p><p>where 2; is the mole fraction of component i and G? is the Gibbs energy of the phase in question at pure i.

It can be seen that Ni-rich alloys are more stable in the f.c.c. phase while Cu-rich alloys are more stable in the liquid phase. At some point near the centre of the composition axis, r9, the Gibbs energy of f.c.c. and liquid phases are the same. If this intersection is taken as a start point it can be seen that the Gibbs energy of an alloy of composition zp can lower its Gibbs energy by forming a two-phase mixture of f.c.c. and liquid with the compositions x}, and Ziq respectively (Figure 3.13(b)). Similarly to the case of a miscibility gap, the Gibbs energy of alloy xo can be further minimised until the compositions of the f.c.c. and liquid phases reach zf,.. and xj, respectively, at which point the phases are in equilibrium. This process is then performed over a range of temperatures and the phase diagram plotted as shown in Fig. 3.14.</p><p>It can now be seen that if the thermodynamic properties of the liquid and f.c.c. phases could be determined it would be possible to calculate a phase diagram with- out the need for experimental determination of the phase diagram itself. Indeed, this was done by Pascoe and Mackowiak (1970, 1971) more than 25 years ago and the diagram was in good agreement with that observed experimentally.

In such circumstances a variety of measurement techniques are used to help develop the thermodynamic models, and how this is done will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.</p><h3 id="3.7.1-Topological-features-of-phase-diagrams-calculated-using-regular-solution-theory"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#3.7.1-Topological-features-of-phase-diagrams-calculated-using-regular-solution-theory">3.7.1 Topological features of phase diagrams calculated using regular solution theory</a><a id="3.7.1-Topological-features-of-phase-diagrams-calculated-using-regular-solution-theory-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#3.7.1-Topological-features-of-phase-diagrams-calculated-using-regular-solution-theory" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>It is instructive to look at how changes in phase diagrams can be produced by systematically varying the regular solution parameter of the Gibbs excess energy of mixing as defined by Eq. (3.52). Such a systematic approach has been previously demonstrated by Pelton (1983) and it is worthwhile discussing the changes and types of diagram in more detail. Figure 3.15 shows a series of calculated phase diagrams based on an A-B system involving two phases, one a solid, the other liquid.</p><p>The first row shows the case where large repulsive interactions exist in the solid phase, producing a large miscibility gap, and the liquid regular solution parameter (li) has been varied between -20 and +30 kJ mol”&#39;. The first diagram with Qlia = -20 kJ mol&quot; is characterised by a deep eutectic trough and would be typical of a system such as Au~Si. Such systems are often useful for brazing or soldering applications and can also be good glass formers. As 2 becomes less negative the general topology of the diagram remains similar, even for the case where M4 = +10 kJ mol&quot;! the system is characterised by a eutectic, although it is quite shallow. Such behaviour is typical of systems such as Ag-Bi and Ag-Pb or Cd-Zn and Cd—</p><p>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;figures/placeholder.png&quot; alt&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3.15. Topological features of phase diagrams calculated using regular solution theory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p><p>Pb, where retrograde solubility for the solid in equilibrium with the liquid can also occur. As a critical value of &quot;9 is approached the liquid forms its own miscibility gap and the diagram then exhibits two forms of liquid invariant reaction, the lower temperature reaction being either eutectic or peritectic, while the higher temperature reaction becomes monotectic. Examples of such systems are Cu-Pb and Cu-TI. When 2!&quot;4 becomes even larger, the top of the liquid miscibility gap rises above scale of the graph and there is little solubility of either element in the liquid. Such a diagram is typical of Mg systems such as Mg~Fe or Mg-Mn.</p><p>The second longitudinal series shows what happens when the regular solution parameter of the solid is made less positive (2°! = +15 kJ mol”). Initially, when M9 js negative, there is little apparent difference from the first series. There is a greater extent of solid solubility, but otherwise the type of diagram is very similar. However, as 24 becomes positive the reaction type changes to become peritectic in nature and is typical of such systems as Ag-Pt and Co—Cu. When 19 reaches +20 kJ mol&quot;! the solid miscibility gap becomes apparent and the shape of the liquidus and solidus looks rather strange, with almost a rectangular appearance. Such a diagram is typical of systems such as Au-Pt, Cu-Rh or Ti-W.</p><p>The third and fourth longitudinal series takes the solid interactions to be either ideal, i.e., 2%! = 0, or negative, N°! = -15 kJ mol”!. The form of the diagrams is now completely changed, and they are characterised by complete solubility in the solid phase. The main features to note are (i) minima in the liquid when &quot;9 &gt; Q™, (ii) maxima when 3 &lt; 9%! and (iii) a smooth liquidus and solidus when Oa = Ql,</p><p>The above series of calculations helps demonstrate that all types of topology of phase diagrams involving simple liquid and solid solutions can be calculated within the same simple framework, and diagrams with increasing complexity, i.e., increasing number of phases, compounds, allotropic changes in the elements, etc., can also be routinely handled.</p><h2 id="REFERENCES"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#REFERENCES">REFERENCES</a><a id="REFERENCES-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#REFERENCES" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Nemst, W.
