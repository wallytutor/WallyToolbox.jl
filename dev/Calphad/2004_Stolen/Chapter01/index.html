well-defined system. A thermodynamic system contains everything of thermodynamic interest for a particular chemical process within a boundary. The boundary is either a real or hypothetical enclosure or surface that confines the system and separates it from its surroundings. In order to describe the thermodynamic behavior of a physical system, the interaction between the system and its surroundings must be understood. Thermodynamic systems are thus classified into three main types according to the way they interact with the surroundings: isolated systems do not exchange energy or matter with their surroundings; closed systems exchange energy with the surroundings but not matter; and open systems exchange both energy and matter with their surroundings. </p><p>#boundary, #surroundings, #system/isolated, #system/closed, #system/open </p><p>The system may be homogeneous or heterogeneous. An exact definition is difficult, but it is convenient to define a homogeneous system as one whose properties are the same in all parts, or at least their spatial variation is continuous. A heterogeneous system consists of two or more distinct homogeneous regions or phases, which are separated from one another by surfaces of discontinuity. The boundaries between phases are not strictly abrupt, but rather regions in which the properties change abruptly from the properties of one homogeneous phase to those of the other. For example, Portland cement consists of a mixture of the phases <span>$\beta-Ca_2SiO_4$</span>, <span>$Ca_3SiO_5$</span>, <span>$Ca_3Al_2O_6$</span> and <span>$Ca_4Al_2Fe_2O_10$</span>. The different homogeneous phases are readily distinguished from each other macroscopically and the thermodynamics of the system can be treated based on the sum of the thermodynamics of each single homogeneous phase.</p><p>#system/homogeneous, #system/heterogeneous, #phases</p><p>In colloids, on the other hand, the different phases are not easily distinguished macroscopically due to the small particle size that characterizes these systems. So although a colloid also is a heterogeneous system, the effect of the surface thermodynamics must be taken into consideration in addition to the thermodynamics of each homogeneous phase. <strong>In the following, when we speak about heterogeneous systems, it must be understood (if not stated otherwise) that the system is one in which each homogeneous phase is spatially sufficiently large to neglect surface energy contributions.</strong> The contributions from surfaces become important in systems where the dimensions of the homogeneous regions are about <span>$1\:\mu{}m$</span> or less in size. The thermodynamics of surfaces will be considered in Chapter 6.</p><p>#colloids</p><p>A homogeneous system - solid, liquid or gas - is called a solution if the composition of the system can be varied. The components of the solution are the substances of fixed composition that can be mixed in varying amounts to form the solution. The choice of the components is often arbitrary and depends on the purpose of the problem that is considered. The solid solution <span>$LaCr_{1-y}Fe_yO_3$</span> can be treated as a quasi-binary system with <span>$LaCrO_3$</span> and <span>$LaFeO_3$</span> as components. Alternatively, the compound may be regarded as forming from <span>$La_2O_3$</span>, <span>$Fe_2O_3$</span> and <span>$Cr_2O_3$</span> or from the elements <span>$La$</span>, <span>$Fe$</span>, <span>$Cr$</span> and <span>$O_2(g)$</span>. In <span>$La_2O_3$</span> or <span>$LaCrO_3$</span>, for example, the elements are present in a definite ratio, and independent variation is not allowed. <span>$La_2O_3$</span> can thus be treated as a single component system. We will come back to this important topic in discussing the Gibbs phase rule in <a href="../Chapter04/">Chapter 4</a>.</p><p>#solution</p><h3 id="Thermodynamic-variables"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Thermodynamic-variables">Thermodynamic variables</a><a id="Thermodynamic-variables-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Thermodynamic-variables" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>In thermodynamics the state of a system is specified in terms of macroscopic state variables such as volume, <span>$V$</span>, temperature, <span>$T$</span>, pressure, <span>$p$</span>, and the number of moles of the chemical constituents <span>$i$</span>, <span>$n_i$</span>. The laws of thermodynamics are founded on the concepts of internal energy (<span>$U$</span>), and entropy (<span>$S$</span>), which are functions of the state variables. Thermodynamic variables are categorized as intensive or extensive. Variables that are proportional to the size of the system (<em>e.g.</em> volume and internal energy) are called extensive variables, whereas variables that specify a property that is independent of the size of the system (<em>e.g.</em> temperature and pressure) are called intensive variables.</p><p>#variablel/state, #state-functions, #variable/intensive, #variable/extensive</p><p>A state function is a property of a system that has a value that depends on the conditions (state) of the system and not on how the system has arrived at those conditions (the thermal history of the system). For example, the temperature in a room at a given time does not depend on whether the room was heated up to that temperature or cooled down to it. The difference in any state function is identical for every process that takes the system from the same given initial state to the same given final state: it is independent of the path or process connecting the two states. Whereas the internal energy of a system is a state function, work and heat are not. Work and heat are not associated with one given state of the system, but are defined only in a transformation of the system. Hence the work performed and the heat adsorbed by the system between the initial and final states depend on the choice of the transformation path linking these two states.</p><p>#energy/work, #energy/heat</p><h3 id="Thermodynamic-processes-and-equilibrium"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Thermodynamic-processes-and-equilibrium">Thermodynamic processes and equilibrium</a><a id="Thermodynamic-processes-and-equilibrium-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Thermodynamic-processes-and-equilibrium" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>The state of a physical system evolves irreversibly towards a time-independent state in which we see no further macroscopic physical or chemical changes. This is the state of thermodynamic equilibrium, characterized for example by a uniform temperature throughout the system but also by other features. A non-equilibrium state can be defined as a state where irreversible processes drive the system towards the state of equilibrium. The rates at which the system is driven towards equilibrium range from extremely fast to extremely slow. In the latter case the isolated system may appear to have reached equilibrium. Such a system, which fulfills the characteristics of an equilibrium system but is not the true equilibrium state, is called a metastable state. Carbon in the form of diamond is stable for extremely long periods of time at ambient pressure and temperature, but transforms to the more stable form, graphite, if given energy sufficient to climb the activation energy barrier. Buckminsterfullerene, <span>$C_{60}$</span>, and the related <span>$C_{70}$</span> and carbon nanotubes, are other metastable modifications of carbon. The enthalpies of three modifications of carbon relative to graphite are given in Figure 1.1 (1, 2).</p><p>#equilibrium, #metastability, #irreversibility</p><p>Glasses are a particular type of material that is neither stable nor metastable. Glasses are usually prepared by rapid cooling of liquids. Below the melting point the liquid become supercooled and is therefore metastable with respect to the equilibrium crystalline solid state. At the glass transition the supercooled liquid transforms to a glass. The properties of the glass depend on the quenching rate (thermal history) and do not fulfill the requirements of an equilibrium phase. <strong>Glasses represent non-ergodic states, which means that they are not able to explore their entire phase space, and glasses are thus not in internal equilibrium.</strong> Both stable states (such as liquids above the melting temperature) and metastable states (such as supercooled liquids between the melting and glass transition temperatures) are in internal equilibrium and thus ergodic. Frozen-in degrees of freedom are frequently present, even in crystalline compounds. Glassy crystals exhibit translational periodicity of the molecular center of mass, whereas the molecular orientation is frozen either in completely random directions or randomly among a preferred set of orientations. <strong>Strictly  spoken, only ergodic states can be treated in terms of classical thermodynamics.</strong></p><p>#glass, #supercooling, #quench #egodic-states #frozen-in</p><p>![[ch01/fig1<em>1.png]] Figure 1.1 Standard enthalpy of formation per mole <span>$C$</span> of C</em>{60}$ (1), <span>$C_{70}$</span> (2) and diamond relative to graphite at 298 K and 1 bar.</p><p></p><h2 id="The-first-law-of-thermodynamics"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#The-first-law-of-thermodynamics">The first law of thermodynamics</a><a id="The-first-law-of-thermodynamics-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#The-first-law-of-thermodynamics" title="Permalink"></a></h2><h3 id="Conservation-of-energy"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Conservation-of-energy">Conservation of energy</a><a id="Conservation-of-energy-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Conservation-of-energy" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>The first law of thermodynamics may be expressed as: <strong>Whenever any process occurs, the sum of all changes in energy, taken over all the systems participating in the process, is zero.</strong></p><p>The important consequence of the first law is that energy is always conserved. This law governs the transfer of energy from one place to another, in one form or another: as heat energy, mechanical energy, electrical energy, radiation energy, etc. The energy contained within a thermodynamic system is termed the internal energy or simply the energy of the system, <span>$U$</span>. In all processes, reversible or irreversible, the change in internal energy must be in accord with the first law of thermodynamics.</p><p>#energy/first-law, #energy/conservation, #energy/internal </p><p>Work is done when an object is moved against an opposing force. It is equivalent to a change in height of a body in a gravimetric field. The energy of a system is its capacity to do work. When work is done on an otherwise isolated system, its capacity to do work is increased, and hence the energy of the system is increased. When the system does work its energy is reduced because it can do less work than before. When the energy of a system changes as a result of temperature differences between the system and its surroundings, the energy has been transferred as heat. Not all boundaries permit transfer of heat, even when there is a temperature difference between the system and its surroundings. A boundary that does not allow heat transfer is called adiabatic. Processes that release energy as heat are called exothermic, whereas processes that absorb energy as heat are called endothermic.</p><p>#adiabatic, #process/endothermic, #process/exothermic</p><p>The mathematical expression of the first law is</p><p class="math-container">\[\Sigma{}dU=\Sigma{}dq + \Sigma{}dw = 0\]</p><p>where <span>$U$</span>, <span>$q$</span> and <span>$w$</span> are the internal energy, the heat and the work, and each summation covers all systems participating in the process. Applications of the first law involve merely accounting processes. Whenever any process occurs, the net energy taken up by the given system will be exactly equal to the energy lost by the surroundings and vice versa, <em>i.e.</em> simply the principle of conservation of energy.</p><p>In the present book we are primarily concerned with the work arising from a change in volume. In the simplest example, work is done when a gas expands and drives back the surrounding atmosphere. The work done when a system expands its volume by an infinitesimal small amount <span>$dV$</span> against a constant external pressure is</p><p class="math-container">\[dw = -p_{ext}dV\]</p><p>#energy/work/mechanical #energy/work/electromagnetic </p><p>Table 1.1 Conjugate pairs of variables in work terms for the fundamental equation for the internal energy <span>$U$</span>.

Several types of work terms may be involved in a single thermodynamic system, and electrical, mechanical, magnetic and gravitational fields are of special importance in certain applications of materials. A number of types of work that may be involved in a thermodynamic system are summed up in Table 1.1. The last column gives the form of work in the equation for the internal energy.</p><h3 id="Heat-capacity-and-definition-of-enthalpy"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Heat-capacity-and-definition-of-enthalpy">Heat capacity and definition of enthalpy</a><a id="Heat-capacity-and-definition-of-enthalpy-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Heat-capacity-and-definition-of-enthalpy" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>In general, the change in internal energy or simply the energy of a system <span>$U$</span> may now be written as</p><p class="math-container">\[dU = dq + dw_{pV} + dw_{non-e}\]</p><p>where <span>$dw_{pV}$</span> and <span>$dw_{non-e}$</span> are the expansion (or <span>$pV$</span>) work and the additional non-expansion (or non-<span>$pV$</span>) work, respectively.

If a phase transformation (<em>i.e.</em> melting or transformation to another solid polymorph) takes place within the system, heat may be adsorbed or released without a change in temperature. At constant pressure the heat merely transforms a portion of the substance (<em>e.g.</em> from solid to liquid - ice - water).

Hence the energy changes must be well defined. It is often convenient to choose a reference state as an arbitrary zero. Often the reference state of a condensed element/compound is chosen to be at a pressure of 1 bar and in the most stable polymorph of that element/compound at the temperature at which the reaction or process is taking place. This reference state is called a standard state due to its large practical importance.  The term standard state and the symbol <span>$^0$</span> are reserved for <span>$p = 1\:bar$</span>. The term reference state will be used for states obtained from standard states by a change of pressure. It is important to note that the standard state chosen should be specified explicitly, since it is indeed possible to choose different standard states. The standard state may even be a virtual state, one that cannot be obtained physically.</p><p>#energy/enthalpy/reference-state #energy/enthalpy/standard-state</p><p>Let us give an example of a standard state that not involves the most stable polymorph of the compound at the temperature at which the system is considered. Cubic zirconia, <span>$ZrO_2$</span>, is a fast-ion conductor stable only above 2300 °C. Cubic zirconia can, however, be stabilized to lower temperatures by forming a solid solution with for example <span>$Y_2O_3$</span> or <span>$CaO$</span>.

In order to describe the thermodynamics of this solid solution phase at, for example, 1500 °C, it is convenient to define the metastable cubic high-temperature modification of zirconia as the standard state instead of the tetragonal modification that is stable at 1500 °C.

Graphite thus transforms to the much denser diamond modification of carbon at 1.5 GPa at 298 K.</p><p>Equation (1.73) applies to each substance in a reaction and a change in the Gibbs energy of a reaction going from pj to p¢ is given by</p><p>(1.74) </p><p>![[ch01/fig1_9.png]] Figure 1.9 Standard Gibbs energy of graphite and diamond at T = 298 K relative to the standard Gibbs energy of graphite at | bar as a function of pressure.</p><p>![[ch01/fig1_10.png]] Figure 1.10 The standard Gibbs energy of formation from the binary constitutent oxides of the kyanite, sillimanite and andalusite modifications of Al7SiOs as a function of pressure at 800 K. Data are taken from [3]. All three oxides are treated as incompressible.</p><p>A,V is not necessarily positive, and to compare the relative stability of the different modifications of a ternary compound like AlpSiOs the volume of formation of the ternary oxide from the binary constituent oxides is considered for convenience. The pressure dependence of the Gibbs energies of formation from the binary constituent oxides of kyanite, sillimanite and andalusite polymorphs of AljSiOs are shown in Figure 1.10. Whereas sillimanite and andalusite have positive volumes of formation and are destabilized by pressure relative to the binary oxides, kyanite has a negative volume of formation and becomes the stable high-pressure phase. The thermodynamic data used in the calculations are given in Table 1.7 [3].!</p><p>1 Note that these three minerals, which are common in the Earth’s crust, are not stable at ambient pressure at high temperatures. At ambient pressure, mullite (3Al203-2SiO2), is usually found in refractory materials based on these minerals. </p><p>Table 1.7 Thermodynamic properties of the kyanite, sillimanite and andalusite poly- morphs of Al7SiOs at 800 K [3]. ![[ch01/tab1_7.png]]</p><h2 id="Open-systems"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Open-systems">Open systems</a><a id="Open-systems-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Open-systems" title="Permalink"></a></h2><h3 id="Definition-of-the-chemical-potential"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Definition-of-the-chemical-potential">Definition of the chemical potential</a><a id="Definition-of-the-chemical-potential-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Definition-of-the-chemical-potential" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>A homogeneous open system consists of a single phase and allows mass transfer across its boundaries.
