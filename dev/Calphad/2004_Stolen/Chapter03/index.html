Svein Stolen and Tor Grande Copyright 2004 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. ISBN: 0-471-49230-2</p><p>Solution thermodynamics</p><p>So far we have discussed the thermodynamic properties of materials, which have been considered as pure and to consist of only a single component. We will now continue with systems containing two or more components and thereby solutions. Solutions are thermodynamic phases with variable composition, and are common in chemical processes, in materials and in daily life. Alloys — solutions of metallic elements — have played a key role in the development of human civilisation from the Bronze Age until today. Many new advanced materials are also solutions. Examples are tetragonal or cubic ZrO2, stabilized by CaO or Y203, with high toughness or high ionic conductivity, and piezoelectric and dielectric materials based on BaTiO3 or PbZrO3. In all these cases the mechanical or functional proper- ties are tailored by controlling the chemical composition of the solid solution. The chemical and thermal stability of these complex materials can only be understood if we know their thermodynamic properties.</p><p>The understanding of how the chemical potential of a component is changed by mixing with other components in a solution is an old and fascinating problem. The aim of this chapter is to introduce the formalism of solution thermodynamics. Models in which the solution is described in terms of the end members of the solu- tion, solution models, are given special attention. While the properties of the end members must be described following the methods outlined in the previous chapter, the present chapter is devoted to the changes that occur on formation of the solutions. In principle one could describe the Gibbs energy of a mixture without knowing the properties of the end members, but since it is often of interest to apply a solution model in thermodynamic calculations involving other phases, the solu- tion model often is combined with descriptions of the Gibbs energies of the end members to give a complete thermodynamic description of the system.</p><p>57  –- 58 3 Solution thermodynamics 3.1 Fundamental definitions</p><p>Measures of composition</p><p>The most important characteristic of a solution is its composition, i.e. the concen- tration of the different components of the phase. The composition of a solution is best expressed by the ratio of the number of moles of each component to the total number of moles. This measure of the composition is the mole fraction of a com- ponent. In the case of a binary solution consisting of the components A and B, the mole fractions of the two components are defined as</p><p>n n x, =—A— and xp =—B— G.1) ny +ng ny +ng</p><p>and it is evident that</p><p>Xa +XB (3.2) For an infinitesimal change in composition of a binary solution the differentials of the two mole fractions are related as</p><p>dx, =-drp (3.3)</p><p>In dealing with dilute solutions it is convenient to speak of the component present in the largest amount as the solvent, while the diluted component is called the solute.</p><p>While the mole fraction is a natural measure of composition for solutions of metallic elements or alloys, the mole fraction of each molecule is chosen as the measure of composition in the case of solid or liquid mixtures of molecules.! In ionic solutions cations and anions are not randomly mixed but occupy different sub-lattices. The mole fractions of the atoms are thus an inconvenient measure of composition for ionic substances. Since cations are mixed with cations and anions are mixed with anions, it is convenient for such materials to define composition in terms of ionic fractions rather than mole fractions. In a mixture of the salts AB and AC, where A is a cation and B and C are anions, the ionic fractions of B and C are defined through</p><p>X_=—&quot;8</p><p>B= (3.4) ng +nce</p><p>1 Note that volume fraction rather than mole fraction is recommended in mixtures of molecules with significant different molecular mass. This will be discussed in Chapter 9.  –- 3.1 Fundamental definitions 59</p><p>In a binary solution AB—AC, the ionic fractions of B and C are identical to the mole fractions of AB and AC. It may therefore seem unnecessary to use the ionic fractions. However, in the case of multi-component systems the advantage of ionic fractions is evident, as will be shown in Chapter 9.</p><p>Mixtures of gases</p><p>The simplest solution one can imagine is a mixture of ideal gases. Let us simplify the case by assuming only two types of ideal gas molecules, A and B, in the mix- ture. The total pressure in this case is the sum of the partial pressures of the two components (this is termed Dalton’s law). Thus,</p><p>Prot = PA + PB (3.5)</p><p>where pa and pp are the partial pressures of the two gases and po is the total pres- sure. By applying the ideal gas law (eq. 2.23), the volume of the gas mixture is</p><p>Viot =&quot;AVm,A +&quot; BVm,B (3.6)</p><p>where na and ng are the number of moles of A and B in the mixture and Vm,q and Vm,B are the molar volumes of pure A(g) and B(g). In this case, where both A and B are ideal gases, Viy,.4 = Vm,p- It follows that, for a mixture of ideal gases</p><p>PA =XAProt (3.7)</p><p>The chemical potential of an ideal gas A is given by eq. (2.26) as</p><p>Ha (Py) = HS + RT In Pa =&quot;S +RT Inpy (3.8)</p><p>Py</p><p>where HA is the standard chemical potential of the pure ideal gas A at PS = 1 barat a given temperature 7. For a mixture of the ideal gases A and B at constant pressure (Prot = PS =1 bar) the chemical potential of A for a given composition of the solu- tion, xa, is, by using eq. (3.7)</p><p>XAPrtot_ =U +RT Inxg (3.9) ° Pr</p><p>Haq) =HQ +RT In</p><p>The difference between the chemical potential of a pure and diluted ideal gas is simply given in terms of the logarithm of the mole fraction of the gas component. As we will see in the following sections this relationship between the chemical potential and composition is also valid for ideal solid and liquid solutions.  –- 60 3 Solution thermodynamics</p><p>In mixtures of real gases the ideal gas law does not hold. The chemical potential of A of a mixture of real gases is defined in terms of the fugacity of the gas, fq. The fugacity is, as discussed in Chapter 2, the thermodynamic term used to relate the chemical potential of the real gas to that of the (hypothetical) standard state of the gas at | bar where the gas is ideal:</p><p>Ma (xa) =H + RT In] a =H. +RT In(fa) (3.10)</p><p>Pr</p><p>Solid and liquid solutions - the definition of activity</p><p>In the solid or liquid state the activity, a, is introduced to express the chemical potential of the components of a solution. It is defined by</p><p>Ma =Ha +RT Inay G.11)</p><p>where Ma is the chemical potential of A in the reference state. For p = 1 bar La, = Hy. One of the most important tasks of solution thermodynamics is the choice of an appro- priate reference state, and this is the topic of one of the following sections.</p><p>3.2 Thermodynamics of solutions</p><p>Definition of mi</p><p>ing properties</p><p>The volume of an ideal gas mixture is given by eq. (3.6). Let us now consider only solid or liquid mixtures. Our starting point is an arbitrary mixture of na mole of pure A and ng mole of pure B. The mixing process is illustrated in Figure 3.1.

The volume before mixing is</p><p>V(before) =n 4Vn,a +”2BVm.B (3.12)</p><p>where V,,,4 and V,,,p are the molar volumes of pure A and B.

These partial molar volumes may be seen as apparent vol- umes that when weighted with the number of A and B atoms give the observed total volume of the solution.

By comparing eqs. (3.9) and (3.10) we see that the fugacity/activity of the ideal gas is equal to the mole fraction. A solution (gas, liquid or solid) is in general called ideal if there are no extra interactions between the different species in addi- tion to those present in the pure components. Thermodynamically this implies that the chemical activity is equal to the mole fraction, a; = x;, over the entire composi- tion range. The molar Gibbs energy of mixing for an ideal solution then becomes</p><p>Ail Gm =RT (xq Inxy +X In-xp) (3.25)</p><p>The Gibbs energy of mixing of an ideal solution is negative due to the positive entropy of mixing obtained by differentiation of Al Gm with respect to temperature:</p><p>id 2A ix Gm MnixSm =~ a =-R(x, Inx, + Xp In xg) (3.26)</p><p>P</p><p>In the absence of additional chemical interactions between the different species that are mixed the solution is stabilized entropically; the solution is more disor- dered than a mechanical mixture of the components. The origin of the entropy con- tribution is most easily understood by considering the distribution of two species on a crystalline lattice where the number of lattice sites is equal to the sum of the number of the two species A and B. For an ideal solution, a specific number of A and B atoms can be distributed randomly at the available sites, i.e. in a large number of different ways. This gives rise to a large number of different structural configurations with the same enthalpy and thus to the configurational entropy given by eq. (3.26). This will be discussed further in Chapter 9.</p><p>Two other characteristic properties of ideal solutions are</p><p>id —aid a id = AM Hy =A) Gm + TA Sy =0 (3.27) aa’ G id a mix’™ | _¢ (3.28) mix ~~</p><p>Ip</p><p>Or in words: in the absence of additional chemical interactions between the two types of atom, the enthalpy and volume of mixing are both zero.</p><p>The partial molar properties of a component i of an ideal solution are readily obtained:  –- 64 3 Solution thermodynamics</p><p>— {aa G Ani =| =RT In x; (3.29) on ‘ PT NM jai ‘a aa’ Gi; Mix di =- a =-Rin x; (3.30) DTN jzi ° PN joi</p><p>The thermodynamic properties of an ideal binary solution at 1000 K are shown in Figure 3.3.

The largest entropic stabilization corresponds to the minimum Gibbs energy of mixing, which for an ideal solution is RT Ing) or —RT In 2, or about 0.7 times the thermal energy (R7) at 1000 K.</p><p>Excess functions and deviation from ideality</p><p>Most real solutions cannot be described in the ideal solution approximation and it is convenient to describe the behaviour of real systems in terms of deviations from the ideal behaviour.

The dif- ferent atoms are assumed to be randomly distributed in the solution. This means that the excess Gibbs energy is most often assumed to be purely enthalpic in nature. However, in systems with large interactions, the excess entropy may be large and negative.</p><p>As shown above, the activity coefficients express the departure from ideality and thus define the excess Gibbs energy of the solution. Deviation from ideality is said to be positive when y &gt; 1 (In 7 is positive) and negative when y&lt; 1 (In y is negative). A negative deviation implies a negative contribution to the Gibbs energy relatively to an ideal solution and hence a stabilization of the solution relative to ideal solu- tion behaviour. Similar arguments imply that positive deviations from ideality result in destabilization relative to ideal solution behaviour.</p><p>The activities of Fe and Ni in the binary system Fe—Ni [3] and the corresponding Gibbs energy and excess Gibbs energy of mixing are shown in Figures 3.4 and 3.5, respectively. The Fe—Ni system shows negative deviation from ideality and is thus stabilized relative to an ideal solution. This is reflected in the negative excess Gibbs energy of mixing. The activity coefficients y;, defined by eq. (3.33) as a;/x;, are readily determined from Figure 3.4. 7; for the selected composition xyj = 0.4 is given by the ratio MQ/PQ. At the point of infinite dilution, x; = 0, the activity coefficient takes the value y;°. y;° is termed the activity coefficient at infinite dilution and is, as will be discussed in Chapter 4, an important thermodynamic characteristic of a solution. The activity coefficient of a given solute at infinite dilution will generally depend on the nature of the solvent, since the solute atoms at infinite dilution are surrounded on average by solvent atoms only.

Although the standard state in principle can be chosen freely, the standard state is in practice not taken by chance, but does in most cases reflect the type of model one wants to fit to experimental data. The choice of  –- 68 3 Solution thermodynamics</p><p>standard state is naturally influenced by the data available. In some cases the vapour pressure of one of the components is known in the whole compositional interval. In other cases the activity of the solute is known for dilute solutions only.</p><p>In the following, the Raoultian and Henrian standard states will be presented. These two are the far most frequent standard states applied in solution thermody- namics. Before discussing these standard states we need to consider Raoult’s and Henry’s laws, on which the Raoultian and Henrian standard states are based, in some detail.</p><p>Henry&#39;s and Raoult&#39;s laws</p><p>In the development of physical chemistry, investigations of dilute solutions have been very important. A dilute solution consists of the main constituent, the solvent, and one or more solutes, which are the diluted species. As early as in 1803 William Henry showed empirically that the vapour pressure of a solute i is proportional to the concentration of solute i:</p><p>Pi = Xk (3.41)</p><p>where x; is the mole fraction solute and ky ; is known as the Henry’s law constant. Here we have used mole fraction as the measure of the concentration (alternatively the mass fraction or other measures may be used).</p><p>More than 80 years later Frangois Raoult demonstrated that at low concentra- tions of a solute, the vapour pressure of the solvent is simply</p><p>Pi =XiPi (3.42)</p><p>where x; is the mole fraction solvent and D; is the vapour pressure of the pure solvent.</p><p>Raoult’s and Henry’s laws are often termed ‘limiting laws’. This use reflects that real solutions often follow these laws at infinite dilution only. The vapour pressure above molten Ge-Si at 1723 K [4] is shown in Figure 3.6 as an example. It is evi- dent that at dilute solution of Ge or Si, the vapour pressure of the dominant compo- nent follows Raoult’s law. Raoult’s law is expressing that a real non-ideal solution approaches an ideal solution when the concentration of the solvent approaches unity. In the corresponding concentration region Henry’s law is valid for the solute. The Ge-Si system shows positive deviation from ideality and the activity coeffi- cients of the two components, given as a function of x; in Figure 3.6(b), are thus positive for all compositions (using Si and Ge as standard states).</p><p>Raoult’s law is obeyed for a solvent at infinite dilution of a solute.

It can be shown that Raoult’s law behaviour of the solvent follows as a consequence of Henry’s law behaviour for the solute, while the reverse does not follow.</p><p>Raoultian and Henrian standard states</p><p>The Raoultian standard state is the most frequently used standard state for a com- ponent in a solution. The Raoultian standard state implies that all thermodynamic properties are described relative to those of the pure component with the same structure as the solution. For liquids the specification of the structure seems artifi- cial, but for solid solutions, which may have different crystal structures, this is of great importance. The activity of Ni in molten Fe—Ni at 1850 K using the Raoultian standard state is given in Figure 3.7 (ordinate given on the left-hand y-axis). The activity of pure Ni is set as standard state and is thus unity. While the Raoultian standard state represents a real physical reachable state, the Henrian standard state is a hypothetical one. The Henrian standard state for Ni in the Fe—Ni solution is found by extrapolation of the Henrian law behaviour at xyj_,9 to xy =1; see Figure</p><p>1.0</p><p>0.8 1.0 0.6 H ak, an 0.4 05</p><p>0.2 0.0 0.0</p><p>0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 08 1.0</p><p>Ni</p><p>Figure 3.7 The activity of Ni of molten Fe—Ni at 1850 K using both a Raoultian and a Henrian standard state.

The molar Gibbs energy of mixing of the Fe-Ni system for which the activity of Ni is shown in Figure 3.7 is given in Figure 3.8.

Data are taken from reference [3].  –- 3.4 Analytical solution models 73 3.4 Analytical solution models</p><p>Dilute solutions</p><p>Binary solutions have been extensively studied in the last century and a whole range of different analytical models for the molar Gibbs energy of mixing have evolved in the literature. Some of these expressions are based on statistical mechanics, as we will show in Chapter 9. However, in situations where the inten- tion is to find mathematical expressions that are easy to handle, that reproduce experimental data and that are easily incorporated in computations, polynomial expressions obviously have an advantage.</p><p>Simple polynomial expressions constitute the most common analytical model for partial or integral thermodynamic properties of solutions:</p><p>n ¥(xp)=Qo + Qi xp +O xp +..+O, 28 = VOjx4, (3.60) i=0 or ¥(xp)= xa xB Ri(xq — xp)! = xp— xp) Ril -2xp)&#39; (3.61) i=0 i=0</p><p>The variable x is usually the mole fraction of the components. The last expression was first introduced by Guggenheim [5]. Equation (3.60) is a particular case of the considerably more general Taylor series representation of Y as shown by Lupis [6]. Let us apply a Taylor series to the activity coefficient of a solute in a dilute binary solution:</p><blockquote><p>a2</p></blockquote><p>Inyg=Inyp -{G20) xB +5 oie Xpte XB )r— 30 ax, 930 3.62) i ah o&#39;iInyg xi iN at B )x_-90</p><p>The derivatives of the Taylor series are all finite. It is not necessary to expand the series at xg = 0, but it is most common and convenient for dilute solutions. The Taylor series expansion of In yg may be expressed in a different notation as</p><p>a Inyp= dP xh (3.63) i=0  –- 74 3 Solution thermodynamics</p><p>0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 “TL</p><p>Figure 3.9 An illustration of low-order terms in the Taylor series expansion of In; for dilute solutions using Iny-y, for the binary system TI-Hg at 293 K as example.

The coefficient of zeroth order is just the value of In yg at infinite solution. The first-order coefficient is the most used and is often designated by ep [7]. This coefficient is a measure of how an increase in the concentration of B changes In yg, which explains why it is called the self-interaction coefficient. The expression for In yg with only three coefficients is</p><p>Inyg=Inyg +epxg +P x (3.65)</p><p>The orders of magnitude of the coefficients depend very much on the system studied. Generally stronger atomic interactions give larger interaction coefficients. An illustration of low order terms in the Taylor series expansion of In y7 in the binary system TI-Hg is given in Figure 3.9 [8].</p><p>The same type of polynomial formalism may also be applied to the partial molar enthalpy and entropy of the solute and converted into integral thermodynamic properties through use of the Gibbs—Duhem equation; see Section 3.5.</p><p>Solution models</p><p>The simplest model beyond the ideal solution model is the regular solution model, first introduced by Hildebrant [9]. Here A,ix Sj, is assumed to be ideal, while A mix m is not. The molar excess Gibbs energy of mixing, which contains only a single free parameter, is then  –- 3.4 Analytical solution models 75</p><p>AX Ga, = OX XB (3.66)</p><p>mix</p><p>where Q is named the regular solution constant or the interaction coefficient. The molar Gibbs energy is in this approximation</p><p>Gm =XaHX +xXply t+ RT (xq Inxa + Xp Inxg) + Qxa xB (3.67)</p><p>The molar Gibbs energy of mixing AmixGm =RT (xq Inxay + Xp In-xg) + Qxa xB (3.68) thus consists of one entropic and one enthalpic contribution: AmixSm =—R(%,q Inx, + Xp In xg) (3.69) Amix4m = 2X4 %p (3.70)</p><p>For ideal solutions Q is zero and there are no extra interactions between the spe- cies that constitute the solution. In terms of nearest neighbour interactions only, the energy of an A-B interaction, wap, equals the average of the A~A, waa, and B-B, Upp, interactions or</p><p>2 =2L nan Finn +o) (3.71)</p><p>where z is the coordination number and L is Avogadro’s number. For the general case of a non-ideal solution Q &lt; 0 gives an increased stability of the solution rela- tive to an ideal solution, while Q &gt; 0 destabilizes the solution. It follows that Q&lt;0 and Q &gt; 0 are usually interpreted as attraction and repulsion, respectively, between the A and B atoms. Repulsion between the different atoms of the solution will imply that the atoms do not mix at absolute zero, where the entropic contribution is zero. Complete solubility will be obtained when the temperature is raised suffi- ciently so that the entropy gain due to randomization of the atoms is larger than the positive enthalpic contribution to the Gibbs energy. The integral Gibbs energies of systems with Q/RT larger and smaller than zero are shown in Figure 3.10. The regular solution model can be extended to multi-component systems, in which case the excess Gibbs energy of mixing is expressed as mal.

In cases where the deviation from ideality is not symmetrical, the regular solution model is unable to reproduce the properties of the solutions and it is then necessary to introduce models with more than one free parameter. The most convenient poly- nomial expression with two parameters is termed the sub-regular solution model.</p><p>AiG m =XAXB(AgX, + Ayn Xp) (3.74)</p><p>If more than two parameters are necessary a general polynomial expression may be applied: exe Udy pj AG m “Ldap (3.75) i=l j=</p><p>The Redlich-Kister expression 2 Axe m =X, XplQ + Aj(x,q — xg) + Ay (XQ — XB)~ (3.76) +A3(Kq — xB) te]</p><p>is a frequently used special case of this general polynomial approach. While the first term is symmetrical about x = 0.5, the second term changes sign for x = 0.5. The compositional variation of the third and fourth terms is given in Figure 3.11. In all these models the entropy of mixing is assumed to be ideal and the excess Gibbs energy is an analytical model for the enthalpy of mixing.</p><p>The entropy of mixing of many real solutions will deviate considerably from the ideal entropy of mixing. However, accurate data are available only in a few cases. The simplest model to account for a non-ideal entropy of mixing is the quasi-reg- ular model, where the excess Gibbs energy of mixing is expressed as  –- 3.4 Analytical solution models 77</p><p>Contribution to</p><p>0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0</p><p>Figure 3.11 Contributions to the molar excess Gibbs energy of mixing from the four first terms of the Redlich—Kister expression (eq. 3.76).
